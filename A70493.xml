            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <q>Amongſt many other Truths which were of neceſſity to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, for the paſſing of this Beaſt <hi>(Antichriſt)</hi> unto his great power and authority, and for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſafe guarding of him in the poſſeſſion thereof, this is one of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb facs="tcp:96115:5"/>conſideration, That Chriſtians may lawfully in a lawful way ſtand up to defend themſelves, in caſe they be able, againſt any unlawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, by what Aſſailants, or by what pretended Authority ſoever made upon them: for had this Opinion been timeouſly enough, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially taught in the Church, it would certainly have cauſed an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion in Antichriſts birth, and ſo have diſappointed the Devil of his firſt-born, had not the Spirits, and Judgments, and Conſciences of men been as it were cowed and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly embaſed and kept under, and ſo prepared for Antichriſts Lure, by Doctrines and Tenets exceſſively ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the power of Superiours o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Inferiours, and binding Iron yokes and heavie burdens on thoſe that were in ſubjection; doubtleſs they would never have bowed down their backs ſo low, as to let ſuch a

                  </gap> have reſigned up their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Conſciences into the hands of ſuch a Spiritual Tyrant as he. So that you ſee there was a ſpecial neceſſity, for the letting of Antichriſt into the world; yea and for the continuance of him in his Throne, that no ſuch Opinion as this which we ſpeak of, whether truth or untruth, ſhould be taught and believed; I mean, which vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicateth and maintaineth the juſt Rights, and Liberties, and Priviledges of thoſe that live under authority and ſubjection to others. Whereas now on the contrary, that time of Gods preordination and purpoſe for the downfal of Antichriſt drawing neer, there is a kind of neceſſity that thoſe truths, which have ſlept for many years, ſhould now be awakened; and particularly, <hi>That God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal and diſcover unto his faithful
<pb facs="tcp:96115:6"/>Miniſters and other his ſervants, the juſt bounds and limits of Authority and Power, and conſequently the juſt and full extent of the lawful Liberties of thoſe that live in ſubjection. —E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident it is, that they are the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Chriſtians, I mean Chriſtians of ordinary Rank and Quality, that ſhall be moſt active, and have the principal hand in executing the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon the Whore.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4, 5, 6. Now that this ſervice ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto God by them, (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians I mean of under Rank and Quality) contrary to the will, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or commands of thoſe Kings and Princes under whom they live, it appears by that which immediately followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</q> And whereas the Text ſaith expreſly that the <hi>ten Kings</hi> ſhall <hi>hate the whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire; for God hath
<pb facs="tcp:96115:7"/>put it in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree and give their Kingdom unto the Beaſt until the Words of God ſhall be fulfilled:</hi> To prevent this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, becauſe God in his good time will arm the Kings to fight <hi>joyntly</hi> the Lords battel againſt the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> he thus interprets that place; <q>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (ſaith he) this is not meant of the perſons of Kings, but of their States and Kingdoms, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) of the generality of the people under them, <hi>p.</hi> 32.</q> As if the meaning of— <hi>The Kings ſhall hate the Beaſt,</hi> were, <hi>The People ſhall hate their Kings,</hi> and <hi>rebel</hi> againſt them, in order to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S often as I conſider the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Pamphlets which the Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of this Age have brought forth, it calls to my mind what I have read of a ſort of Indian Rats, which are ſaid to be preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whilst they are in the belly of their Dams. Every Libel propagates ſuch a numberleſs Iſſue, that, as one obſerved of the increaſe of Faction, the first Separation might ſay to its Off-ſpring, <hi>Ariſe, Separation, and go to thy Separation; for thy Separation's Separation hath a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of all the Libels that have been lately written, none are more fruitful (as it is moſtly with Venomous Creatures) than thoſe which have been written against the Eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. There was a Swarm of ſuch in the Late <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappie Times; and ſome of the Authors,
<pb facs="tcp:96115:13"/>(as well as that ſort of Writings) are yet alive, or revived, to create new Diſturbances: And as <hi>Horace</hi> obſerves,

                  <l>Tulit progeniem vitioſiorem.</l>
               </q>
Every Pamphlet hath more of venome, than that from whence it had its birth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prynne, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> were the Great Grandſires of this monſtrous Progenie: The <hi>Covenanters, Nye, Marſhal,</hi> and the <hi>Smectymnuans,</hi> were their genuine Off-ſpring. To theſe ſucceed (notwithſtanding the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Vote for Excluſion) <hi>John Goodwin, Owen, Harington,</hi> and <hi>Baxter;</hi> all right Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-men; with <hi>Milton,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and many others, whoſe Writings have by men of like Principles been reviewed, reprinted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the preſent Age.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely inſtance in the Treatiſe now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, which hath contracted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Antimonarchical principles which lay ſcattered in the Authors last mentioned, and in <hi>the Character of the Popiſh Succeſſor, Plato Redivivus,</hi> and other ſeditious Pamphlets; but eſpecially from Mr. <hi>Hunt's Poſtſcript:</hi> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our Author's <hi>teeth</hi> were <hi>ſet on edge</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s <hi>ſowre Grapes;</hi> and he makes it his buſineſs to blow up the Coals which <hi>he</hi> had kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
<pb facs="tcp:96115:13"/>The great Notion on which all his Diſcourſe is builded, is from Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. <hi>46,</hi> &amp; <hi>47.</hi> (And <hi>facile eſt inventis addere). Let no man</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>) <hi>betray his Countrie and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by pretending the example of the patience and ſufferings of the Primitive Chriſtians for our Rule. The Reformed Religion hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a Civil right, and the protection of Laws. If we ought not to loſe our Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, but where forfeited by Law; we ought much rather not to loſe them for the profeſſion of the beſt Religion, which by Law is made the Publick National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> &amp;c. This gave occaſion to the greatest part of his Book, which is a loud and notorious Calumny against the Primitive Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> their patient ſubmiſſion to their unjust and cruel Perſecutors.</p>
            <p>From Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> he took his inſtance of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, of whom he ſpeaks, <hi>p. 48.</hi> and ſays, <hi>Scarce a Child but hath heard what was done, ſaid, and maintained by the Clergie of</hi> England <hi>in the caſe of</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of Scots, a Popiſh Succeſſor, in the earlieſt time of our Reformation.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this our Author paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth at large, from <hi>p. 12.</hi> to the 18th of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p>His deriding of the Succeſſion in the right Line, is taken from Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. <hi>47. If any be ſo vain as to ſay that a lawful courſe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb facs="tcp:96115:14"/>is eſtabliſhed among us by Divine Right, he is a man fitted to believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and the Infallibility of the Pope.</hi> And our Authors Comments on this, fill many pages. Concerning Arbitrary Power, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. <hi>42.</hi> and <hi>52.</hi> with the <hi>78.</hi> of our Author's: and <hi>p. 241.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> minded him of the Doctrine of <hi>Sibthorpe</hi> and <hi>Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> of which in <hi>p. 77.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>P. 47.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Compariſon between <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> gave him a Text for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his book; and from a hint in <hi>p. 49. That we muſt not ſuſpend all the legal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we have for our preſervation upon the life of our preſent King;</hi> there are a hundred hints for that one, to prepare people for actual Reſiſtance and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>the Leproſie of</hi> Naaman <hi>cleaves to this covetous</hi> Gehazi, and ſpreads it ſelf through the whole book, ſo as it becomes a continued Scab. And I pray God it may creep no farther.</p>
            <p>But for this one thing our Author is very cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, that having got theſe and many other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for his <hi>Babel,</hi> he never mentions his Founder: Onely, <hi>p. 88.</hi> he ſays, <hi>A worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath lately obſerved, That one ſingle Arm unreſiſted, may go a great way in murdering a Nation.</hi> But <hi>works of darkneſs hate the light,</hi> and therefore he thought fit to conceal both their names.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96115:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Author of <hi>the Life of</hi> Julian ſeemeth very fit to deſcribe an Apoſtate, having himſelf apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from the Doctrine of the Church whereof he hath long profeſſed himſelf to be a Member, as alſo from the judgment and practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, against whom his book is a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Libel; and by which (if it ſhould be credited) he would wound the Reputation of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians more than <hi>Julian</hi> hath done. For he ſays himſelf, That <hi>(but for their name)</hi> Julian <hi>had better have fallen among ſo many Barbarians than among them,</hi> p. <hi>66.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two things are what I deſigne: first, to wipe off the dirty Aſperſions cast by the Author on the Chriſtians in <hi>Julian</hi>'s time, which have more of an Invective against them, than any thing that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> wrote against <hi>Julian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And ſecondly, to prevent the infection of thoſe falſe and dangerous Opinions in the caſe of Obedience to Magiſtrates, which this diſtempered Generation are too much diſpoſed to receive, and (as is uſual with infected perſons) to propagate, and make them epidemical. I intend not a Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor of <hi>Julian,</hi> though (as the Proverb ſays) <hi>The Devil is not ſo black as he's painted,</hi> (let <hi>Baal</hi> plead for himſelf) I onely deſigne a ſhort Apologie for the Primitive Chriſtians, whom our Author repreſents as ſo many Apoſtates from their Predeceſſors in the days of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> when by their patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb facs="tcp:96115:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>they more honoured the Goſpel, than the Chriſtian Emperours did by all the Priviledges and Largeſſes wherewith they endowed the Church.

               <p>OUr Author ſeems better read in the <hi>Alcaron</hi> than the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> that hath found out a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon for his Majeſties Subjects from a Viſion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he might have found more ſuitable repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of them from the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> as in <hi>David</hi>'s Subjects, who were careful <hi>not onely of his ſafety,</hi> but <hi>all his houſe,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.14. Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles have delivered for the good of all ſucceeding Ages, ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Examples of Chriſtian obedience and ſubjection, as the moſt loyal <hi>Addreſſers</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96115:16"/>(even the <hi>men of Rippon</hi> themſelves) come ſhort of. It was their bounden duty at ſuch a time to make their Profeſſion to adhere to <hi>his Majeſtie, his Heirs and Succeſſors;</hi> it was no more than what the Law of God and the Nation hath obliged them to; ſo that they are neither <hi>Guelphs,</hi> nor <hi>Gibelines,</hi> nor <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> but ſuch as are ready to <hi>render unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſar, and unto God the things which are Gods:</hi> nor could they ſufficiently expreſs their thankfulneſs to his Majeſtie, (when too many began to exerciſe an arbitrary way of vexing their fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſuperſede the eſtabliſhed Laws) for his gracious Declaration to <hi>govern according to the eſtabliſhed Laws,</hi> and (which is that which gives offence to too many) <hi>to cauſe others to do ſo too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They know beſt how to reconcile <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> that could ſwallow <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Engagements</hi> after the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy,</hi> and all their Obligations to God and his Church, and knew how to make a <hi>glorious King</hi> by bringing him to the <hi>Block,</hi> and to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> Religion by <hi>dividing</hi> it, which our Saviour ſays is the readie way to <hi>deſtroy</hi> it: for <hi>a Kingdom or houſe divided cannot ſtand.</hi> If the men of <hi>Rippon</hi> had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> apprehenſion of the miſchiefs that in all probability would follow upon <hi>a Bill of Excluſion,</hi> I cannot ſee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96115:16"/>but their Fears were more reaſonable than the groundleſs Jealouſie of ſuch as trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with what may never be; or if it ſhould, is but a juſt judgment of God to puniſh thoſe by ſome <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who were ſo malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the pious and peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> And I have often thought, that one reaſon why God ſet a <hi>Julian</hi> over the Chriſtians of that Age, was, becauſe in the times of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> they degenerated into Hereſies and Schiſms, (ſuch as the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi>) and began to <hi>bite and devour one another.</hi> The Shepherds have generally obſerved, that when Sheep puſh and chaſe each other, it betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an approaching Storm.</p>
               <p>As to what you mind us of, <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5. That <hi>a Popiſh Succeſſor will be an heavie judgment of of God, and ought to be deprecated by all good men:</hi> As far as Prayers and Tears and other lawful endeavours may be employed, all good men will readily joyn with you: but if it ſhall pleaſe God for our wantonneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governableneſs to lay that heavie Yoke upon us, it is in vain to reſiſt, <hi>lest we be found to fight against God.</hi> I ſhall at preſent onely ſend you to a Heathen to learn better behaviour; <hi>Quomodo ſterilitatem aut nimios imbres, &amp; cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera naturae mala; it à luxum vel avaritiam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minantium tolerate, vitia erunt donec homines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96115:17"/>ſed neque haec continua, &amp; meliorum interventu penſantur,</hi> i. e. As we endure ſcarcity or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate rain, and other natural evils; ſo ought we to bear with the luxury or avarice of our Rulers, for there will be faults as long as there are men: but neither are theſe ſtill continued; the interchange of what is good, will make compenſation for that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour would have us to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtracting fear of thoſe events which are not in our power to prevent, eſpecially when our groundleſs fears may be the chief cauſe of drawing thoſe evils on our ſelves. Few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions were ever hatcht, but by the warmth of a pretended zeal for <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> (how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoever) have animated it, and given it growth and ſtrength. <hi>The panick fear of a change of Government,</hi> (he means Arbitrary Government) <hi>was the principal cauſe of the late War,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> in his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> p. 52. The noiſe of <hi>Popery</hi> to be brought in by the King and Archbiſhop <hi>Land,</hi> who were <hi>the Heads of the Grotian Papiſts,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays) was another: yet I hope neither Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> nor our Author will warrant that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion under their hands, upon ſuch falſe and ungodly pretences, when they ſhall conſider to what real evils theſe feigned Bugbears and Fancies did precipitate us.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96115:17"/>
               <p>It is true, a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> will be an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>ſincere Proteſtants,</hi> in reſpect of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral accommodations, and ſpiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages alſo; yet that evil may be improved to our eternal advantages, our Saviour having promiſed, that <hi>great ſhall be their reward in heaven,</hi> that are <hi>reviled, perſecuted, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, for his ſake,</hi> Matth. 5.11, 12. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>If we ſuffer for well-doing, and take it patiently, this is acceptable with God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.20. And if it be the Will of God if ſhall be ſo, we muſt learn of <hi>David,</hi> though in another caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.8. <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth, for it was thy doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 5. You ſeem not ſatisfied with <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> Receipt of <hi>Citò, longè, tardè,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many Confeſſors in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and is preſcribed by a greater than <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in this very caſe; <hi>If they perſecute you in one City, flee to another,</hi> Matth. 10.23. You are for <hi>Fires and Fumes of Pitch and Tar, &amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Impriſonment</hi> and <hi>cloſe Confinement</hi> even of <hi>innocent perſons.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch <hi>Cauſticks</hi> in caſes of <hi>Hereſie, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny;</hi> but I never read that the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> uſed them againſt their Princes, not againſt <hi>Diocleſian</hi> a Tyrant, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> an Arian, or <hi>Julian</hi> an Apoſtate. Nay even the <hi>Doctors of Rome</hi> forbid ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96115:18"/>even in the caſe of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> without which the other two may not much hurt a ſound Chriſtian, till the Diſeaſe be <hi>univerſalis manifeſta, &amp; cum obſtinatione,</hi> (i. e.) till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they find all other means ineffectual, and he is reſolved to make a total overthrow of his People. Concerning which we are yet in the dark as to our own Caſe; and you give us ſome light to comfort us, when you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 65. of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Perſecution, That it was <hi>but a flea-biting, a ſhort and weak aſſault of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and that he was <hi>rather a Tempter than a Perſecutor:</hi> which makes their behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him (if it were ſo barbarous as you repreſent it) the leſs excuſable. Until a Plague be <hi>epidemical</hi> and <hi>waſting,</hi> it is not charitable nor juſt to <hi>confine ſuſpected perſons;</hi> much leſs them that are <hi>ſound,</hi> and to deal with them as perſons deſtined to deſtruction, to bury them alive; and to make their own <hi>Relations</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of theſe ſeverities, who may juſtly fear the like are intended for <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though ſome intend onely to lop off a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Branch,</hi> yet having got the Ax in their hand, others may make uſe of it to ſtrike a blow at the <hi>Root;</hi> and (to anſwer your Parentheſis) <hi>plain Engliſh is as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood on this ſide</hi> Trent <hi>as the other;</hi> ſo that there is more fear leſt we ſhould loſe a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant King</hi> (as we have once already) than
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96115:18"/>a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor:</hi> for though ſuch an one may be deprecated as a Judgment, and may prove as a Plague to the Nation, yet may we not preſently cut Throats to prevent what may never come, or if it ſhould, make uſe of a Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe: for, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.23.</p>
               <p>That Remedy which you ſuppoſe may be effectual to prevent this miſchief, will prove to be of that nature; which is a Compound of <hi>belying</hi> the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Modern ones</hi> into a ſin of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which may do more hurt (as Experience hath ſhewn us) than all the Arts and Witchcrafts of <hi>Julian:</hi> In writing of whoſe <hi>Life,</hi> you have not, I confeſs, <hi>impoveriſhed the Subject</hi> (p. 6.), for you have onely <hi>weeded it,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath done the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane one</hi> of the Biſhops and Councils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>P. 7. You ſay, you <hi>wrote this diſcourſe onely to render that of</hi> Julian<hi>'s Succeſſion intelligible.</hi> It is a ſtrange courſe you take to <hi>make his Succeſſion intelligible,</hi> which you your ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs was from God by a legal deſcent, and moſt agreeable to the Laws of the Roman Empire, and yet ſeek to overthrow it: you had done more to your purpoſe, if you had ſhewn what <hi>party of Chriſtians</hi> they were, and on what <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> they went, what <hi>Sedition</hi> or <hi>Armies</hi> the Chriſtians
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96115:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>had raiſed to oppoſe his Succeſſion; of all which you give us not the leaſt notice; you onely ſuppoſe, that if <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had known <hi>Julian</hi>'s Religion before he was Emperour, he would have gotten a Bill of Excluſion; or if not, the Chriſtians would have reſiſted him.</p>
               <p>And from their behaviour towards him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was Emperour, (which is ſcandalouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented, as is alſo the carriage of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chriſtians) you would <hi>reconcile</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi> This you have done intelligibly enough: but that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> did or would have reſiſted his Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I find no ſhew of Argument or Hiſtorie; onely you give us ſome <hi>Rhetorical expreſſions</hi> out of St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s <hi>Invectives,</hi> from which you infer more than the Premiſes will bear. And you do not <hi>report,</hi> as it becomes an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but onely <hi>ſuggest, adde,</hi> and <hi>invent</hi> what may inſnare your Readers. I ingenuouſly confeſs, I do not believe all that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſpeaks in praiſe of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> nor againſt <hi>Julian. Panegyricks,</hi> and <hi>Stelliteuticks,</hi> have not the authoritie of <hi>true Hiſtories,</hi> with diſcerning men.</p>
               <p>P. 7. You ſay your buſineſs is <hi>to ſhew how wide a difference there was betwixt the Caſe of Chriſtians in</hi> Julian<hi>'s time, and that of the first Chriſtians;</hi> and make it as great <hi>as Laws for men and against men could poſſibly make it:</hi> yet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96115:19"/>you confeſs that what you have written is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is commonly reported of them, and to the carriage of former Chriſtians.</hi> It is then ſome ſuch <hi>New Light</hi> as <hi>Jo. Goodwin</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine of Reſiſtance,</hi> that is your Guide: but you take no notice of the unalterable Laws of God, which bind all men in all Ages to be <hi>ſubject to the Higher Powers</hi> without diſtinction, <hi>not onely for fear of Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> There are few men that intend a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but will pretend to have the Laws on their ſide; and if they may be Judges in their own Caſe, will as certainly <hi>condemn the Legiſlator,</hi> as <hi>diſpute his Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were well if you would keep cloſe to your Principle, <hi>That the Laws of your Country are the Meaſures of your civil Obedience.</hi> I am ſure you want none to require your <hi>active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to the juſt Laws of your Prince; nor your <hi>paſſive Obedience,</hi> if at any time you ſuffer wrongfully: And this is not injoyn'd by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but by <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf; it is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and not of the <hi>Bow-ſtring.</hi> The violation of the Law on the Princes ſide, doth not diſcharge the Obligation of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; they are under a higher Law than that of the Land. The chief Magiſtrate's obliging himſelf to certain Rules for adminiſtration of his Government, is not the juſt Meaſure or chiefeſt Tye of the Subjects Obedience. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96115:20"/>eternal Laws of God and our Saviour, that require Obedience and Submiſſion even to wicked Princes, and that <hi>for Conſcience ſake,</hi> and threatning <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> with <hi>Damnation,</hi> is a ſafer Rule for the ſaving of our Souls, though not for the preſervation of our Lives and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>When St. <hi>Peter</hi> drew a Sword to defend his Maſter, in a way of reſiſting, and revenging him againſt the Officers of a lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, he was commanded to <hi>put up his Sword,</hi> and threatned, that <hi>they that uſe the Sword ſhould periſh by the Sword,</hi> Matth. 26.52. And when ſome other Diſciples would have his conſent to <hi>call for fire from heaven</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> he tells them, <hi>they knew not what Spirit they were of.</hi> The contrary Doctrines are not from the <hi>bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> but the <hi>accurſed Jeſuits,</hi> and to be abhorred of all good Chriſtians: and yet it is that which you chiefly track, and ſeek to bring into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. St. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſpeaking of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s uſing the <hi>Sword,</hi> and of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſlaying the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> ſays, <hi>lib.</hi> 22. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Contra Fauſtum Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terque Juſtitiae regulam exceſſit; &amp; hie fraterno, ille Dominico amore peccavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 8. You ſay, <hi>It is impoſſible in ſo ſhort a Treatiſe as yours is to ſay the tenth part of what is to be ſaid, to ſhew how intolerable that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> (of Paſſive Obedience) <hi>is, and how
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96115:20"/>contrary to the Goſpel, and the Law of the Land.</hi> If you had not ſaid the tenth part of what you have, to ſhew how intolerable the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> is, and that it is contrary to the Goſpel and the Law of the Land; you had ſaid too much, as will appear hereafter. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity indeed doth not enſlave us, or deveſt us of the Rights and Priviledges that we have; but it teacheth us to exchange them for better. <hi>Terreſtria non eripit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sedulius.</note> 
                  <hi>qui regna dat Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia.</hi> And it aſſures us, that <hi>he that loſeth his life for Chriſts ſake, ſhall ſave it,</hi> Matth. 16.25.</p>
               <p>P. 8. To prove your Aſſertion from the Goſpel, you commend your Reader to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Paraphraſe on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. which ſpeaks little to your purpoſe; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns onely ſuch Chriſtians as were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to heathen Maſters. —<hi>That if they could by any fair and regular means attain their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they might make uſe of them, and prefer Liberty before Servitude; which they might have done if they had never been Chriſtians: And that they who have obtained Liberty, and were formerly Servants to Heathen, ſhould not ſell themſelves again, and revert to that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlavery, but prefer Liberty rather.</hi> But what is this to that Expoſition which he gives us of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. in theſe words? —<hi>Then for the Judicial Laws, that great ſupreme one ought to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96115:21"/>be taken into ſpecial care of all Chriſtians, that of Obedience to the Supreme Powers rightly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and conſtituted, although they be not</hi> Jews <hi>but</hi> Romans. <hi>Nothing in Chriſtianity ought to be pretended or made uſe of to give any man immunity from Obedience, which from all Subjects, of what quality ſoever, Apoſtles, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is due to thoſe to whom Allegiance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</hi> (<hi>contrary to the</hi> Gnoſticks <hi>Doctrine and Practice,</hi> Jude 8.) <hi>but on the contrary, every perſon under government, of what Rank ſoever, is to yield ſubjection to his Supreme Governour legally placed in that Kingdom, as to him that hath commiſſion from God, as every Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate must be reſolved to have, though he be a Heathen.</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>From which Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it is directly conſequent, that he that makes any violent reſiſtance or oppoſition to the Supreme. Magiſtrate, oppoſeth that violence to Gods Commiſſion, and ſhall accordingly receive that puniſhment which belongs to ſo ſacrilegious a Contumacie; the wrath and judgment of God belongs to it.</hi> With more to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s dealing with the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.25. the Apoſtle neither ſpake nor acted any thing that tended to reſiſtance; he onely asked the Centurion, <hi>Is it lawful for you to ſcourge a man that is a</hi> Roman, <hi>and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned?</hi> In like manner, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.39. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> onely made the Officers ſenſible of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96115:21"/>their wrongful impriſonment. It is ſtrange that any man that pretends to <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> ſhould wreſt theſe places to the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> when the Doctrine which Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught and practiſed, and which we have received from this great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, is ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to it. <hi>Maledicta Gloſſa quae corrumpit Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xtum.</hi> What conſequence is this? St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> got their liberty by <hi>pleading their Priviledges;</hi> Therefore it is lawful to <hi>reſist.</hi> It is againſt the yielding of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> to the Supreme Magiſtrate, that you urge it.</p>
               <p>P. 9. <hi>As for the Laws of the Land, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> (you ſay) <hi>overthrows</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. That Chapter ſays thus: <hi>No Freeman ſhall be taken or impriſoned, or diſſeized of his Freehold and Liberties,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by lawful Iudgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.</hi> But if any or all theſe ſhould happen to ſome particular man, will that juſtifie a <hi>Rebellion?</hi> When a Roman Emperour gave a Senator a Sword, ſaying, <hi>If I rule well, uſe it for me; if otherwiſe, against me;</hi> was it intended think you by him that gave, or him that received it, that an Act of <hi>Violence,</hi> or <hi>a High Court of Juſtice</hi> ſhould be employed againſt that Emperour upon every Tranſgreſſion? (the Apoſtles rule of Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96115:22"/>
                  <hi>non obſtante</hi>). It is a ſad return of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, when Chriſtian Princes have granted the greateſt Priviledges and Immunities to their Subjects, that they ſhould on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be requited with Affronts and Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>P. 9. and 10. You propoſe the Caſe of a Purſevant ſlain in the execution of a Warrant out of the High-Commiſſion-Court; and then adde, <hi>Any man may ſee that my Diſcourſe doth not deſcend to ſuch petty matters as falſe Arreſts.</hi> True: it is evident enough you flie at a more noble Game, the <hi>reſiſting of Princes</hi> and their <hi>lawful Succeſſors.</hi> I pray ſpeak out: When King <hi>CHARLES</hi> of bleſſed memory came to the Houſe of Commons to demand <hi>Juſtice</hi> againſt the five Members, againſt whom he had <hi>Articles of Treaſon</hi> prepared, was it lawful for the Parliament to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and to raiſe that War that coſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand lives, and millions of money, on pretence of a <hi>breach of their Priviledges,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to deliver them up to a <hi>legal Trial?</hi> I doubt the man that killed the Purſevant did not well know whether his Authority were lawful or not; if he did, he might more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſubmitted, than drawn the bloud of an unadviſed man. But however, <hi>Currat Lex,</hi> let the Law have its courſe; and if by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it be interrupted, or overflow its juſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96115:22"/>bounds, we may not for that cauſe dam up the <hi>Fountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 11. You ſay <hi>you have honeſtly purſued the end of our Saviours coming into the world,</hi> Luke 9.56. <hi>Not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> But doubtleſs, whereas the <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel teacheth, hath deſtroyed one mans life, (and that our Saviour aſſures us is not <hi>lost,</hi> but <hi>exchanged</hi> for a better) the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> hath deſtroyed thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. And you may ſee plainly by the Context, our Saviour commends <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and not <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> as the means to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve mens lives.</hi> You rather purſue another end, which our Saviour mentions, not as a proper effect of his Goſpel, but of the malice of men againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.24. <hi>I came not to ſend peace, but a ſword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 11. That <hi>the Laws of the Land have taken particular care of thoſe who are put on an inevitable neceſſity of defending themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. How far a man that is aſſaulted, and put on an inevitable neceſſity of defending himſelf againſt the injuries of private men, is one thing; and what he may do againſt his Prince, (of whom you ſeem to diſcourſe) is another: In this caſe we may apply that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10. <hi>He that killeth with the ſword, ſhall be killed with the ſword. This is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96115:23"/>and faith of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 11. <hi>This Doctrine</hi> (of Paſſive Obedience) you ſay, <hi>quite alters the Oath of Allegiance,</hi> which requires you to be <hi>obedient to all the Kings Majeſties Laws, Precepts, and Proceſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſame.</hi> I do not find thoſe words in that Oath, as ſet forth by King <hi>James;</hi> but I find what you overlook <hi>(viz.) I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majeſtie, his Heirs and Succeſſors, and him and them will defend to the utmost of my power, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Conſpiracies and Attempts whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> And thus I find more particularly in a Declaration (which I believe our Author hath ſubſcribed) thus amplified: <hi>I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it is not lawful upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to take Arms against the King: And that I do abhor that traiterous Poſition of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arms by his Authority against his Perſon, or against thoſe that are commiſſionated by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 11. After a large Preface little to your purpoſe, telling us, That <hi>the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>reſerves her Faith entire for the Canonical books of Scripture</hi> (which I hope you alſo do,) and that <hi>ſhe divides her Reverence between the Fathers and the first Reformers of this Church, who partly were Martyrs that died for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and partly Confeſſors that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſetled it.</hi> (And now to the buſineſs.)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96115:23"/>
                  <hi>How much the Fathers would have been for a Bill of Excluſion</hi> (you ſay) <hi>we have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</hi> No, not one word of it from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor I believe any mention of it from one Argument tending to it to the end of the Book, from any of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as will ſhortly appear. But what ſay our <hi>Martyrs, Confeſſors,</hi> and <hi>Reformers?</hi> Firſt he tells us what ſome men would have perſwaded King <hi>Edward</hi> to do, if they could have had their wills confirmed by Act of Parliament: <hi>They ſhewed what they would have done if they could,</hi> ſaith our Author: They never ſpake ſuch <hi>bad Engliſh</hi> as our Author doth in his <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Dean</hi> Proverb, <hi>Chud eat more Cheeſe an chad it;</hi> which being interpreted, is, <hi>We would rebel if we had power.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> indeed did cauſe the Lady <hi>Jane Gray</hi>'s Title to be proclaimed, but here the Biſhops muſt be the men that were chiefly engaged in that deſigne of <hi>Excluſion:</hi> whereas I read not that any of them were ever conſulted with, nor ever declared any thing to that purpoſe; but in their joynt and moſt ſolemn Writings enjoyn the clean contrary, as ſhall now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>P. 12. <hi>The Biſhops in Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s time, to whom, under God and that Queen, we owe the ſettlement of our Church, concurred to the making of that Statute which makes it High-Treaſon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96115:24"/>in her Reign, and forfeiture of Goods and Chattels ever after, in any wiſe to hold or affirm, That an Act of Parliament is not of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient force and validity to limit and bind the Crown of this Realm, and the deſcent, limitation, inheritance, and government thereof,</hi> 13 Eliz. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. But our Author never conſidered the grounds and reaſons of that Act; <hi>Ex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis moribus bonae Leges;</hi> it was the iniquity of thoſe times, and the traiterous practices of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> which gave occaſion to that Statute: for there were many Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets written by <hi>Saunders</hi> and the Author of <hi>Doleman,</hi> which deni'd the Title of Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> and proclaim'd her an Uſurper; and the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> made actual claim to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> ſhe aſſumed the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and other <hi>Regalia;</hi> and by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates endeavoured to raiſe a Rebellion, and conſpired againſt the life of the Queen; for which cauſes ſhe was condemned, as may appear by her Sentence which was paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, <hi>viz. That divers things were compaſſed and imagined within this Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>with the privity of the ſaid Queen, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Title to the Crown of this Kingdom, and which tended to the hurt, death, and deſtruction of the Royal Perſon of our Soveraign Queen. Cambdens Eliz.</hi> p. 464. (<hi>Leiden</hi> 1625.) Such practices gave occaſion to that Statute, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96115:24"/>prevent the Miſchiefs that might befal Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Nation, And that Statute conſiſts of many heads: As firſt, <hi>Whoever ſhould compaſs, imagine, deviſe, or intend the death or deſtruction, or any bodily harm tending to death, deſtruction, or wounding of the Royal perſon of the Queen, or deprive or depoſe her of or from the Stile, Honour, or Kingly name of the Imperial Crown of this Realm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or leavy War againſt her Majeſty within this Kingdom or without, or move any Strangers to invade this Kingdom or</hi> Ireland, &amp;c. <hi>or ſhall maliciouſly publiſh and declare, by any printing, writing, word, or ſayings, that our Soveraign Lady during her life is not, or ought not to be Queen of this Realm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or that any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons ought of right to be King or Queen of the ſame; or that our ſaid Queen is a Heretick or Schiſmatick, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Infidel, or an Vſurper of the ſaid Crown,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>theſe ſhall he guilty of High-Treaſon. Alſo if any after thirty days from the Seſſion of this Parliament, and in the life of our ſaid Queen, ſhall claim, pretend, declare, or publiſh themſelves or any other beſides our ſaid Queen to have Right or Title to have and enjoy the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>or ſhall uſurp the ſame. or the Royal Stile, Title, or Dignity of the Crown, or ſhall affirm that our ſaid Queen hath not right to hold and enjoy the ſame; ſuch ſhall be utterly diſabled du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96115:25"/>their natural lives onely, to have or enjoy the Crown or Realm of</hi> England <hi>in Succeſſion, Inheritance, or otherwiſe.</hi> Then follows the Caſe of Succeſſion: <hi>That if any perſon ſhall hold or affirm, that the Common Laws of this Realm, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Parliament, ought not to direct the Right of this Crown, or that our ſaid Queen by the Authority of Parliament is not able to make Laws and Statutes of ſufficient force,</hi> &amp;c. as above.</p>
               <p>Yet was not the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Statute of the 13 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> but on that made in the 27 of her Reign; wherein it was provided, <hi>That twenty four perſons at leaſt, part being of the Privy Council, and the reſt Peers of the Realm, ſhould by the Queens Commiſſion examine ſuch as ſhould make any open Rebellion or Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Realm, or attempt to hurt the Queens perſon, by or for any pretended Title to the Crown.</hi> In which Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I find no Biſhop ſave the Archbiſhop, who at firſt refuſed to act: nor when the whole Parliament petitioned for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do we find that the Biſhops (who were denied to vote in caſe of Bloud) did joyn or were conſulted with. And <hi>Cambden</hi> obſerves, that the ſame day when the Sentence was pronounc'd againſt the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> it was declared by the Delegates and Judges of the Kingdom, <hi>That that Sentence ſhould derogate
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96115:25"/>nothing from the Right or Honour of</hi> James <hi>King of</hi> Scots; <hi>but that he ſhould be in the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Order, and Right, as if that Sentence had never been given,</hi> p. 465. So that the whole matter being conſidered, here was no Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> but rather a tacit confirmation of one that was a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> and conſequently, it muſt be a great <hi>ſlander</hi> on thoſe worthy Biſhops by him named, that they were zealous for ſuch Acts of Excluſion: for the buſineſs of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> did concern matters of Treaſon, ſuch as you ſay might exclude her out of the world; as alſo the Reaſons of Sir <hi>Simon d'Ewes</hi> tended to the taking away of her life; and therefore come not home to the Caſe of Succeſſion: nor does Sir <hi>Simon</hi> tell us <hi>whoſe Reaſons</hi> they were; and I ſuſpect them to be the Opinions of ſome <hi>private perſon,</hi> who having ſpoken all-along in the plural number, he diſcovereth himſelf at the end in theſe words; <hi>God I trust in time ſhall open her Majeſties eyes to ſee their cruel purpoſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>P. 18. You ſay (what another hath ſaid before you) That <hi>a Bill of Excluſion is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Courtſhip to theſe Reaſons.</hi> True, if the <hi>Heir apparent</hi> or <hi>preſumptive</hi> were under the ſame circumſtance with that Queen: but 'tis perfect Cruelty to endeavour the like Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> as ſuch onely, not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96115:26"/>onely from his <hi>Right,</hi> but out of his <hi>Life.</hi> And now no man elſe needs <hi>turn his fury or reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon thoſe Biſhops;</hi> you have done that ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>As for your Proteſtation, <hi>p.</hi> 19. that <hi>if but one Reaſon can be given to prove a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to be unlawful, which will be owned to be a Reaſon a week after, and the owners not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, you do ſolemnly promiſe to joyn in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing thoſe Old Reformers, and readily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their New Guides and Lights.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives you a Reaſon which is of eternal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>viz. We may not do evil that good may come of it:</hi> And he aſſures you, that <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of ſuch as affirm the contrary is just,</hi> Rom. 3.8. And to any but an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25. may ſerve as another Reaſon; <hi>The most High ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom he will.</hi> To which adde, <hi>If it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest ye be found to fight against God,</hi> Acts 4.39. And for your <hi>renouncing the Old Reformers,</hi> you have done that with the utmoſt ſpite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that all the Wit of a <hi>Julian</hi> or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of a <hi>Colledge of Jeſuits</hi> could invent, as if they had been the Judges and Executioners of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> under the Notion of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor.</hi> Wherefore I would adviſe our Author to conſider what occaſion he hath given to the Enemies of that Church (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96115:26"/>I ſuppoſe him a <hi>Member,</hi> if not a <hi>Priest</hi>) to <hi>reproach</hi> her: for from this Story of his, no doubt it was, that the ſcurrilous and Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam-Author of the Pamphlet called <hi>Crape-Gownorum</hi> hath thus commented: <hi>It is plain that the Church of</hi> England-<hi>men did hold King-killing, or Queen-killing Doctrine, (which is the ſame thing); ſo that if</hi> Knox, Buchanan, <hi>or</hi> Calvin <hi>first taught the Speculative part, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (meaning thoſe Biſhops named by our Author) <hi>first put it in practice, and ſet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal preſident that others followed,</hi> (that is), in the murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt; for at that he aims, when he threatneth us to <hi>let</hi> 641 <hi>ſleep in Oblivion, lest we awake</hi> 587. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that what was done in the proceſs of that War, (<hi>viz.</hi> that barbarous Murther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated on the Royal Perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt) may be <hi>juſtified</hi> on <hi>the Principles of our Reformers.</hi> Whatever may be <hi>told in Gath,</hi> and <hi>publiſhed in the ſtreets of Askalon,</hi> to make <hi>thoſe Philiſtims rejoyce;</hi> I cannot permit this diabolical <hi>Slander</hi> to paſs without a brand on the <hi>Author</hi> of it here at home; and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thoſe <hi>Worthies,</hi> and ſilence our <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and to prevent the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of this <hi>Forgery,</hi> which may ſtir up the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> of this Nation to act over our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tragedies.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt relate the matter of fact, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96115:27"/>the grounds of that <hi>Severity</hi> which was uſed againſt that Queen; and ſhew you the <hi>most deliberate Judgment</hi> of thoſe <hi>Reverend Biſhops</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Reſiſting lawful Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, As to the matter of fact, it is beyond denial, that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> married the Lord <hi>Darly</hi> a Subject to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who being ſlain, (whether by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or not, I will not determine, but) ſhe was queſtioned by her Subjects for <hi>incontinent living,</hi> the <hi>death of her Husband,</hi> and for <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;</hi> and was forced to reſigne her Crown to her Son, then about thirteen months old; ſo that ſhe was no longer a Crowned head. After which, ſhe raiſeth an Army, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by <hi>Murray;</hi> and being impriſoned, makes an eſcape into <hi>England,</hi> where a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was called to conſult how to diſpoſe of her. It was reſolved, that to let her paſs into <hi>France,</hi> might prove dangerous; and worſe to ſend her back to <hi>Scotland:</hi> And to prevent farther miſchief, ſhe ſhould not be diſmiſſed from <hi>England</hi> till ſhe had made ſatisfaction for the death of her Husband a Subject and Peer of <hi>England,</hi> and for uſurping the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> and pretending a Title to the Crown. During her reſtraint here, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives many Plots againſt the Peace of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; both with <hi>France</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and <hi>D'Alva</hi> Governour of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96115:27"/>and at home, by the Dukes of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (to whom ſhe promiſed marriage) and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland,</hi> who raiſed a Rebellion in the North for her Reſcue: both which ſuffered, the firſt was beheaded, the laſt died in Exile. By her inſtigation a Bull was ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Queen. Then follows the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of <hi>Tho.</hi> and <hi>Edw. Stanly,</hi> Sons to the Earl of <hi>Darby.</hi> Several Invaſions were alſo made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to diſturb that Kingdom, by the joynt Counſels of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th, and a ſwarm of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and contrive with <hi>Throgmorton, Paget,</hi> and others, for another Inſurrection; which was prevented. The Nobles and Gentry ſeeing no hopes of Peace through ſuch daily practices, entered into an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> to proſecute all thoſe even to death that ſhould attempt any thing againſt the Queen; and prevailed for a cloſer reſtraint of her: which notwithſtanding, one <hi>Babington</hi> conveyed Letters between <hi>Her</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and engaged divers to murther the Queen; which was diſcovered to Secretary <hi>Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as alſo the manner how the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> conveyed Letters to the <hi>Spaniſh Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,</hi> and other <hi>Confederates:</hi> whereupon fourteen of them were executed; and in the Parliament convened about that time, <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96115:28"/>the two <hi>Pagets, Englefield, Babington, Salisbury,</hi> &amp;c. were proſcribed. So that the Nation being continually alarmed with the news of <hi>Invaſions, Inſurrections,</hi> and <hi>Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> during the life of that unfortunate Queen, who can blame the Parliament for ſolliciting the execution of a <hi>Just Sentence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all men living, our Author ought not to object it, much leſs to charge the <hi>Biſhops</hi> with that (if they had been guilty) for which they are ready now to pronounce them <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as not conſenting to the Excluſion of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, what the Judgment of thoſe <hi>Reformers</hi> was concerning the Doctrine of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting lawful Princes</hi> on any pretence, I ſhall now demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>P. 103, 104. of his Book, our Author is pleaſed to <hi>recommend the Homilies of our Church to every bodies reading, as one of the best Books that he knows in the world, next to the Bible,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> had done before him). I ſhall therefore intreat him to judge of the Opinion of our <hi>Reformers</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors</hi> in point of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> out of the <hi>publick Doctrines</hi> ſet forth by them in that <hi>excellent Book.</hi> In the firſt Homily <hi>against Diſobedience and wilful Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> they ſay, <hi>p</hi> 277. <hi>If Servants ought to obey their Maſters not onely being gentle, but ſuch as be froward, much more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96115:28"/>ought Subjects to be obedient not onely to their good and courteous, but alſo to their ſharp and rigorous Princes,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.18. And <hi>p.</hi> 278. <hi>It cometh not of Chance or Fortune, nor of the Ambition of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men climbing up of their own accord to Dominion, that there be Kings, Queens, Princes, and other Governours over men being their Subjects; but all Kings, Queens, and other Governours, are ſpecially appointed by the Ordinance of God.</hi> P. 279. <hi>A Rebel is worſe than the worſt Prince, and Rebellion worſe than the worſt Government of the worſt Prince that hitherto hath been.—Whatſoever the Prince be, or his Government, it is evident that for the moſt part thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whom ſome Subjects do think to be very godly, and under whoſe Government they rejoyce to live, ſome other Subjects do take the ſame to be evil and ungodly, and do wiſh for a Change. If therefore all Subjects that miſlike of their Prince ſhould revel, no Realm ſhould ever be without Rebellion.</hi> P. 280. <hi>But what if a Prince be evil indeed, and undiſcreet, and it is evident to all mens eyes that he is ſo? I ask again, What if it be long of the wickedneſs of his Subjects that he is ſo, ſhall the Subjects by their wickedneſs both provoke God for their deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to give them an evil and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Prince, and alſo rebel againſt him, and withal againſt God, who for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96115:29"/>of their ſins did give them ſuch a Prince? Will you hear the Scripture in this point? God maketh a wicked man to raign, for the ſins of the people. Again,</hi> God giveth a Prince in his anger, <hi>meaning an evil one,</hi> and taketh away a Prince in his diſpleaſure, <hi>meaning when he taketh away a good Prince for the ſins of the people: as in our memory he took away our good</hi> Joſias <hi>King</hi> Edward, <hi>for our wickedneſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> God maketh a wiſe and good King to raign over that people whom he loveth, and who love him. <hi>And again,</hi> If the people o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, both they and their King ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper.—<hi>And for Subjects to deſerve through their ſins to have an evil Prince, and then to rebel againſt him, were double and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evil, by provoking God more to plague them, let us either deſerve to have a good Prince, or let us patiently ſuffer and obey ſuch as we deſerve: and whether the Prince be good or evil, let us according to the Scriptures pray for him for his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and increaſe in goodneſs if he be good, and for his amendment if he be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhops that were their Predeceſſors, and our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, were of the ſame judgment, as appears in a Book called <hi>The Inſtitution of a Chriſtian man,</hi> whereof <hi>Cranmer, Ridly,</hi> and other <hi>Martyrs</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96115:29"/>were the Compilers. On the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment they ſay, <hi>Subjects be bound not to withdraw their Fealty, Truth, Love, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards their Prince, FOR ANY CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE WHATSOEVER; ne for any Cauſe may they conſpire against his Perſon, ne do any thing towards the hindrance or hurt thereof, nor of his Eſtate. And by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment they be bound to obey all the Laws, Proclamations, Precepts, and Commandments made by their Princes, except they be contrary to the Commandments of God:</hi> With much more to that purpoſe. And on the Sixth Commandment, <hi>No Subjects may draw their Swords against their Princes, FOR ANY CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE WHATSOEVER IT BE.</hi> — <hi>And though Princes, which be the Supreme Heads of their Realms, do otherwiſe than they ought; yet God hath aſſigned no Judges over them in this world.</hi> The contrary to this is a Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who think it cauſe enough to depoſe a King, becauſe he is a <hi>Proteſtant:</hi> and it is a Leſſon which ſome ſorts of Proteſtants have learnt from them, to depoſe any that is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> A Doctrine which all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> have hitherto condemned: and yet this is the Sophiſtry which our Author hath detected, to his own ſhame, and the honour of thoſe <hi>Worthies</hi> whom he hath reproached: and if our Author's <hi>Politicks</hi> ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96115:30"/>Kings would be of all men moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: for if they be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may <hi>depoſe</hi> them; and if they be <hi>Papiſts, Proteſtants</hi> may <hi>reſist</hi> them; which is <hi>tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 19. Is a diſcourſe againſt the Oath of Allegiance, which he forms in an <hi>Objection</hi> and <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The <hi>Objection</hi> is this: <hi>You are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, and cannot conſent to a Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; if you do, you are forſworn, having long ſince ſworn Allegiance to the King, his lawful Heirs and Succeſſors.</hi> His Anſwer: <hi>Now though the Lawyers tell us an hundred times,</hi> no man can have an Heir as long as he liveth, <hi>yet this will not overcome that deceitful preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice which is occaſioned by our common ſpeech.

One clauſe of that Oath is this: <hi>I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, his Heirs and Succeſſors, and him and them will defend to the utmost of my power, against all Conſpiracies and Attempts whatſoever which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96115:30"/>ſhall be made against his or their perſons, their Crown or Dignity, by reaſon or colour of any ſuch Sentence or Declaration, or otherwiſe: and will do my best endeavour to diſcloſe and make known to his Majeſtie, his Heirs and Succeſſors, all Treaſons and treacherous Conſpiracies which I ſhall know or hear of to be against him or any of them. And I do farther ſwear, That I do from my heart abhor, detest, and abjure, as impious and heretical, this damnable Doctrine and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Princes which be excommunicated or deprived by the Pope, may be depoſed or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by their Subjects or any other whatſoever. —And all theſe things I plainly and ſincerely acknowledge and ſwear, according to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words by me ſpoken, and according to the plain and common ſence and underſtanding of the ſame words, without any Equivocation, or mental Evaſion, or ſecret Reſervation whatſoever,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Your own diſtinction of an <hi>Heir Apparent</hi> and <hi>Preſumptive,</hi> ſeems a ſufficient Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſenſleſs Aſſertion.

And in this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I am confirmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. who ſays, That <hi>though the Heir as long as he is a child,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> as long as his Father liveth) <hi>differeth nothing from a ſervant, yet he is Lord of all:</hi> and if he be a <hi>Son,</hi> or next in Bloud to a Prince whoſe Kingdom is heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, then is he his <hi>Heir,</hi> v. 7. as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues.</p>
               <p>You ſeem to grant, that this is <hi>the Law-ſence</hi> of the words <hi>Heirs and Succeſſors</hi> in an Act of Parliament, as in the <hi>Duty of Exciſe granted to the King, his Heirs, and Succeſſors; But an Oath of Allegiance</hi> (you ſay) <hi>ought to be conceived in plain words, and in the common ſence of thoſe words.</hi> Which I ſhould think to be that which the Lawyers that penned that Oath, and the Lawgivers that enjoyned it, did intend; and unleſs you will juſtifie <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> in their <hi>Equivocations,</hi> and <hi>abſolve</hi> them from the obligation of that Oath, it cannot be taken in any other but the Law-ſence. <hi>Well,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>if it be ſo,</hi> (and ſo it muſt be) <hi>let them be ſure to keep it in that ſence in which they have or ſhould take it at ſixteen years of age in the Court-Leet;</hi> viz.

He brings in another Objection againſt the Bill of Excluſion, <hi>fetched from the Common-Prayer</hi> (to which I perceive he is no great Friend): viz. <hi>No Church of-England-man can be for it with a good Conſcience, being to the prejudice of his R. H. becauſe we there pray that God would</hi> proſper him with all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs <hi>here and hereafter.</hi> Now by the way, no ſuch words (as <hi>here and hereafter</hi>) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, though we grant they are implied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word <hi>All.</hi> But we eſpecially (though not onely) intend it to that happineſs which flows from the Spirit and grace of God, and may bring him and all the Royal Family to Gods <hi>everlaſting Kingdom;</hi> and as a means
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96115:32"/>thereunto, that he would <hi>endue them with his holy Spirit, and enrich them with his heavenly Grace.</hi> You ſay, <hi>No man in the Communion of the Church of</hi> England <hi>prays that Prayer more heartily than you do.</hi> But if you do indeed think him to be a <hi>Julian,</hi> and your ſelf ſuch as thoſe Chriſtians that <hi>ſayd their Prayers back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that <hi>prayed him to death,</hi> and <hi>would not ſo much as deſire his converſion,</hi> this would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a Curſe in the mouth or heart of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proteſtant. And I hope there are no ſuch in the Communion of our Church, though you intimate that they were <hi>all ſuch</hi> in the Primitive Church, and that we ſhould be ſuch alſo: for <hi>p.</hi> 96. you ſay, <hi>You find not one ſingle wiſh among the Antients for</hi> Julian's <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but all for his down-right deſtruction.</hi> It is a good Rule that, <hi>Pro quibus orandum, pro iis laborandum.</hi> We ſhould by a meek and Chriſtian behaviour, inforce our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for 'tis <hi>the Prayer of the Righteous man that availeth much.</hi> If we could thorowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Arguments that prevailed for the reputed defection of that Prince, I believe the unchriſtian behaviour of thoſe who oppoſe his Succeſſion, was moſt cogent. And who knows but our amendment, moderation, and meekneſs, might yet reclaim him? But to pray coldly without faith, for what you ſay (<hi>p.</hi> 22.) there is <hi>no hope,</hi> and to act contrary to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96115:32"/>your Prayers, is to beg a denial. And I hope many others pray more heartily than you do: For when we pray God to <hi>indue him with his Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. we pray that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and not that he may be expoſed to an <hi>invincible Temptation,</hi> and a kind of <hi>neceſſity to extirpate it,</hi> as you maliciouſly accuſe us. Nor are we to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the power of divine Grace either to <hi>reſtrain</hi> or <hi>ſanctifie</hi> thoſe whom we pray for; and ſo to limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as if he had not <hi>the hearts of Kings in his hand,</hi> or had no rule over the Governours of the world. <hi>Cambden,</hi> p. 5. of his <hi>Remains,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that when <hi>Brithwald</hi> the Monk was troubled about the Succeſſion, the Bloud Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al being almoſt extinguiſhed, he heard a voice ſaying, <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>is Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and God will provide for it.</hi> And why ſhould not we acquieſce in the ſame Divine Providence?</p>
               <p>P. 79. You argue againſt a Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour <hi>à poſſibili,</hi> becauſe <hi>he may be a Perſecutor.</hi> Some have accounted both our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and his Father of bleſſed memory ſuch: they ſent the One out of the world with an <hi>Exit Tyrannus,</hi> though the meekeſt and moſt gracious Prince in the world; and what the effects of a <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> as ſome men would manage it, may be, is dreadful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96115:33"/>But as you ſuppoſe the <hi>Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour may</hi> be; ſo I ſuppoſe he <hi>may not</hi> be a Perſecutor. And for the proof of this, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your Friend <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> who in <hi>p.</hi> 207. gives an inſtance in the Prince of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover,</hi> who was perverted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, went to <hi>Rome</hi> to abjure <hi>Hereſie;</hi> and returning home, lived and governed as he did before, without the leaſt animoſity of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for his <hi>change,</hi> or any endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce any to his <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>People;</hi> and dying the laſt Spring, left the peaceable and undiſturbed Rule of his Subjects to the next Succeſſour his Brother the Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> who is a Proteſtant. Now (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays) <hi>there is no new thing under the Sun,</hi> but <hi>what hath been may be;</hi> and if we do our duties, we may be the more confident of the ſucceſs of our Prayers, That God will <hi>endue the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family with his Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.. You do very naughtily therefore to repreſent the caſe as <hi>impoſſible</hi> and <hi>deſperate,</hi> as if God himſelf could not or would not order this great affair for the good of his People. I am almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the ſins of the Nation to which this clamour againſt <hi>Succeſſion</hi> hath given occaſion, by planting in the hearts of too many, malice, bitter enmity, revilings, and even abhorrence of one another, is a greater evil than we are yet like to ſuffer from a Popiſh Succeſſor.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96115:33"/>And did we think he might prove to be <hi>ſuch a one</hi> as he is (too boldly) repreſented, we do very ill to exaſperate and imbitter his Spirit, by ſuch Libels, Slanders, and ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Contrivances as in all probability made <hi>Julian</hi> worſe than he would have been. I therefore heartily wiſh that you had ſpared that <hi>Grinning Complement</hi> (to uſe your term, which you borrowed from Dr. <hi>Howel</hi> in <hi>his life of Julian</hi>) <hi>That if it ſtand with his H.'s good liking, he would enjoy that Religion to the greatest advantage, and take his fill of it at the Fountain-head.</hi> I ſhall rather pray he may never go thither: There are too many Crowned heads at the devotion of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs already. Such Complementers I am ſure do not pray heartily that God would <hi>proſper him with all happineſs here and hereafter.</hi> What? to perſwade him to <hi>cast himſelf down over ſome precipice,</hi> as <hi>Curtis</hi> did, <hi>p.</hi> 19. of <hi>the Character of a Popiſh Succeſſour?</hi> or like that mentioned by our Author to be preſented to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> p. 87. that <hi>to kill himſelf is no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> If it be <hi>out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> none but men of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous intentions will ſo ſpeak.</p>
               <p>P. 23. You are <hi>throughly ſatisfied</hi> (you ſay) <hi>that the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy are Proteſtant Oaths</hi> (<hi>as a great Aſſertor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our Religion and Laws (now with God) thought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96115:34"/>fit to term them</hi>).

Nor is there any new thing at all in that Oath, more than what all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes do generally require of their Subjects. And as for that of <hi>Supremacie,</hi> it is one of the ancient <hi>Regalia</hi> of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which our Parliaments ſtill defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the encroachments of the Pope; ſo that the thing was in being long before King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth brought it into a form: and he was yet a <hi>Popiſh Prince</hi> when he did it. And I have read, that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf would hardly part with the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Supremacie. It is not peculiar then to Proteſtants; or if it were, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that ſome who term themſelves the <hi>true Proteſtants</hi> would be found no great Friends to it: For there are many other Sects, as well as the Anabaptiſts, who are now called <hi>ſound Proteſtants,</hi> refuſe it: And the late Sanctions were intended equally againſt them all. I agree with you, that we are all bound by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96115:34"/>them to endeavour in our place to <hi>keep out Poperie;</hi> but not by <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of <hi>Confuſion.</hi>

               <p>As to what you ſay of <hi>twiſting a Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with theſe Oaths, as</hi> Julian <hi>endeavoured to entangle the Chriſtians.</hi> There are matters more pertinent, and more fully related by St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzene</hi> than by you— <q>There was (ſaith he) an Anniverſarie-day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Emperour beſtowed Donatives of Gold on his Souldiers, when at the ſame time he had provided Fire, Frankincenſe, and ſeveral perſons to perſwade the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to kindle the Incenſe, as an ancient Rite, and more becoming the Imperial Dignity. By ſuch arts and perſwaſions, many of the inconſiderate Souldiers were circumvented, and kindled the Frankincenſe: but, at their return and feaſting together, they drank to each other, and with Eyes lifted up, and uſing the Sign of the Croſs, they made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt. Whereupon one of their Companie ſaid, <hi>What ſtrange thing is this! Do ye call on Chriſt after you have denied him?</hi> At which they being aſtoniſhed, ſaid, <hi>How have we denied him? what is your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>By throwing Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe into the Fire, which is a denial of Chriſt.</hi> Whereat leaping up ſpeedily from their Feaſt, they ran forth as ſo many diſtracted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96115:35"/>men into the Market-place, proclaiming, <hi>We are Chriſtians, we are Chriſtians in our hearts. Let all men hear us, and God above all, to whom we live, and to whom we will die. We have not broken our Covenant with thee, O Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, nor abjured our bleſſed Profeſſion. If our Hands have offended, our Minds are not guilty, It was not the Gold, but the Emperour's fraud that circumvented us: We have put off im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, having been purged in bloud.</hi> Then haſting to the Emperour, and with great reſolution caſting their Gold at his Feet, ſaid, <hi>We have not receiv'd a Donary, O Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but a Condemnation: You called us not to receive marks of Honour, but a brand of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny: Let your Souldiers receive ſuch Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes; ſlay and ſacrifice us to Christ, to whoſe Empire onely we ſubmit our ſelves. Revenge one fire with another, and reduce us to duſt for the dust that we have cast into the fire: Cut off thoſe hands which we have unhappily ſtretched out, and thoſe Feet that carried us to it. Give your Gold to ſuch as may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the receiving it: Chriſt alone ſufficeth us, whom we value above all things.</hi> Having ſaid thus, and informing others of the fraud, and exhorted them to recover themſelves out of this ſnare, and ſatisfie Chriſt even with their Bloud: The Emperour, though highly provoked, would not make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96115:35"/>ſlaughter of them, who as much as in them lay were deſirous of it; he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to be baniſhed.</q> Methinks here is much of the reſolution of the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion, who voluntarily offered themſelves to death, rather than have the guilt of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Incenſe, though without any evil inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the command of the Emperour. From whence I gather, that theſe <hi>Heroick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> thought themſelves under the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in <hi>Julian</hi>'s time, as the <hi>Thebaeans</hi> did in that of <hi>Maximian.</hi> Which is your <gap reason="foreign">

And here you may be inſtructed what you ought to ſay and do, <hi>when a Prince</hi> (as you phraſe it) <hi>ſhall put a border of Popery about his Picture, which you would fain honour;</hi> namely, as theſe noble Confeſſors did; <hi>We reverence your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Authoritie; we will fight your Battles, and follow your Commands; but if you will draw us to Idolatry, (though by the Laws we might reſist) we will rather die at your Feet than do either.</hi> This is the <hi>Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of thoſe exemplarie Souldiers: and this may ſerve alſo to free you from thoſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoughts which had almoſt made you to forget a <hi>paſſage of great conſequence which riſeth up againſt all that you have ſaid,</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> on Pſal. 124. to this effect:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96115:36"/>
                  <hi>That the Chriſtian Souldiers ſerved under this Heathen Emperour; and where their Religion was not concerned, made conſcience of obeying him; but where it came to the Cauſe of Chriſt, there they made as much conſcience of diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</hi> True, they would not obey him, but neither would they riſe up againſt him, <hi>though</hi> (as you take for granted) <hi>they had the Law on their ſide.</hi> They would loſe their Lives rather than offend <hi>God,</hi> or rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their <hi>Emperour:</hi> which is the very thing that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> perſwades, having ſhewn that Servants muſt obey their froward Maſters: <hi>Quod de domino ac ſervo dixi, hoc de Regibus intelligite;</hi> commending <hi>Julians</hi> Souldiers, who for the ſake of their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Heaven,</hi> did ſerve their <hi>Earthly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 26. You would have <hi>the Reader take notice, that the whole Conteſt between</hi> Julian <hi>and thoſe Chriſtians was purely on the ſcore of Religion, and not from any lawleſs and ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable humour.</hi> And certainly ſuch <hi>lawleſs</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable humours</hi> as you mention, did no way become the Chriſtian Religion: for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us to practice <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>forbearance; not to avenge our ſelves, but to give place to wrath; not to ſpeak evil of Dignities, or curſe the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the people.</hi> Whereas you preſent them under ſuch a black Character, as would make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96115:36"/>ſome believe that <hi>they</hi> were the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> and <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and not <hi>Julian.</hi> They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt your own words, <hi>p.</hi> 66. <q>For how do they treat the Emperour, reproaching him, ruffling him, vexing every Vein in his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heart, ſaying all their Prayers backward, and calling down vengeance upon his head— dancing and leaping for joy at his death, and inſulting over his Memory; and but for the name of Chriſtians, he had better fallen among Barbarians: and when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put them in mind of their Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie— they call him by the bloudieſt names of the Devil, for telling them they muſt not avenge themſelves, nor render evil for evil, but pray for and wiſh well to thoſe that injure and perſecute them: and tell him he muſt not think to drive all men up to the top and Pinacle of Virtue; for there are ſeveral Commands in the Goſpel which are no more than Counſels of perfection, which bring Honour and Reward to them that keep them; but to thoſe that do not keep them, no manner of danger at all.</q> 
                  <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det haec Opprobria, &amp;c.</hi> I am ſorry to hear that diſtinction applied to the practice of thoſe Vertues which do more eſpecially diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Chriſtians, and ſhew them to be of a more <hi>excellent ſpirit</hi> than other men: For we need ſuch graces as theſe in our daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96115:37"/>and <hi>what do we more than others, if we onely be kind and loving to them that are ſo to us?</hi> Yet this diſtinction of <hi>Counſels</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> will be but a ſorry excuſe for ſuch as neglect thoſe Duties enjoyned <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If theſe and ſuch-like are <hi>Counſels,</hi> and we may do as the <hi>Julian Chriſtians</hi> are ſaid to do, the deſign of the Goſpel is quite another thing than what all the learned and ſerious profeſſors of it in all Ages have believed and practiſed: <hi>Non tali auxilio aut defenſoribus iſtis Chriſtus egit.</hi> I have heard of ſome that have turned the <hi>Goſpel</hi> into <hi>Burleſque;</hi> but it is more ſtrange, that one whom I ſuppoſe a <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel</hi> ſhould make the grand deſign of it <hi>Ridicule.</hi>

               <p>P. 26. <hi>As for the Souldiers fighting under</hi> Julian <hi>againſt the</hi> Perſians <hi>or any common enemy, and obeying the word of Command, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Pay; it is ſuch a low part of Honeſty, that our Author would have done it himſelf, for his Pay.</hi> But he that would have fought for <hi>Julian,</hi> will ſcarce ſit down quiet under a <hi>Popiſh Prince,</hi> which he thinks to be ten times worſe than a <hi>Julian;</hi> and probably would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as much at ſuch a <hi>ſlippery trick</hi> as was ſhewed to <hi>Julian</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> as (he ſaies) thoſe Chriſtians did that lived under him.

               <p>You ſay, p. 26. <hi>Every body knows how the Church was rent in ſunder by</hi> Arianiſm; <hi>And there might be too much ſtiffneſs and rigidneſs on the other hand about words, for ought I know: but miſerably rent it was; which gave great advantage to</hi> Julian <hi>againſt the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> I know not what our Author means in excuſing the <hi>Arians,</hi> and charging the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> with too much ſtiffneſs. What more dangerous Errour could there be, than to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Deity of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>deny the Lord that bought them?</hi> In ſuch a Caſe, and when almoſt the whole world was turned <hi>Arian,</hi> the <hi>Orthodox</hi> could not be too ſtout and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: and if there were ſo good an Effect of a bad Cauſe, as <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Chriſtians,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Julian;</hi> I wiſh our fears of what you call <hi>a greater evil</hi> might have the like effect on us, whoſe Diviſions have not ſo great a cauſe as abjuring the Deity of our Saviour was.

               <p>P. 27. <hi>Now what did the Chriſtians do?

No, there was no ſeeking to him by either ſide: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the</hi> Donaſtiſts <hi>of</hi> Africk <hi>complemented him, and received ſome ſmall favour from him.</hi> The deſign of <hi>Julian</hi>'s recalling the Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was, as Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians affirm, either to caſt an Odium on <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who had baniſhed them; or to daſh them and the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> againſt each other, thereby to<note n="*" place="margin">Eo modo nomen Chriſti de terris perire putavit, ſi Sacrilegas diſſentiones liberas eſſe permiſit.

'Two or three things I ſhall briefly demonſtrate, on occaſion of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited among themſelves againſt the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</item>
                  <item>2. That they courted <hi>Julian</hi>'s favour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96115:38"/>to ſtrengthen their Faction againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. And</item>
                  <item>3. They did commit greater outrages where they had power, than <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As to the firſt, <hi>Donatus</hi> himſelf wrote a book <hi>de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: the <hi>Macedonians</hi> alſo, who, as St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> obſerves, blotted out of their books that of St. <hi>John, God is a Spirit,</hi> joyned with them. See St. <hi>Ambroſe de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They courted <hi>Julian</hi>'s favour, and got a Toleration, by their flattering Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, applauding him as a man <hi>with whom alone Juſtice did reſide.</hi> And in truth, all that hath been ſaid in favour of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> comes ſhort of what they ſaid in favour of <hi>Julian.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Orthodox</hi> lookt on this Indulgence of the Emperour as a deſigne that would prove fatal to Chriſtianity; for as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, <hi>Quae pejor mors animae, quam libertas erroris?</hi> There is no death ſo evil as the licenſing of error, which is the deſtruction of the Soul: Yet the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> on the contrary are loud in their Acclamations to <hi>Julian</hi> as a moſt gracious Prince; and when he was dead, would, if it had been poſſible, have <hi>prayed him alive again.</hi> And to ingratiate themſelves yet more, they pull down the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96115:39"/>Croſs which <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had ſet up in publick places to the honour of Chriſt, and ſet up <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians Image</hi> in its place. And by how much he was more ſevere againſt the Catholicks, ſo much the more they applauded him: nor would he have done ſo much Miſchief as he did, had not they ſollicited him by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fawning Petitions. Such Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Biſhops as were famous for Learning, were all ſilenced: <hi>Athanaſius</hi> indeed returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but was preſently baniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by their means, who informed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had baptized many Noble Perſons, to the great diſgrace of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Empire and Religion. See <hi>Baronius</hi>'s Annals, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 362. <hi>p.</hi> 115. <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. Mogunt. So that <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregorie, Fugerius Antiochenus,</hi> and both the <hi>Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> were baniſhed and perſecuted by means of the Arians. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls <hi>Julian, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor Chriſti &amp; inimicus,</hi> an Apoſtate from Chriſt, and enemy to his Church: but <hi>veſter Julianus,</hi> ſo great a friend to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that he was wholly theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julian</hi>'s affection to <hi>George</hi> an <hi>Arian Biſhop,</hi> whoſe Writings he earneſtly deſired, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding probably to make uſe of them againſt the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> is recorded by himſelf in his Epiſtles, and was made known by ſetting up him in the place of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96115:39"/>generally did <hi>Arians</hi> in the room of the <hi>Orthodox.</hi> And <hi>Baronius,</hi> p. 117. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> ſaies, <hi>In quos converſus eſt furor Gentilium, Arianorum, pariter &amp; Judaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> they agreed with the moſt oppoſite parties againſt the <hi>Catholicks; Jews, Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Arians.</hi> Perhaps you may give ſome credit to what is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Baxter's Hiſtory of Councils enlarged. The Arians poſſeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> with hard thoughts of <hi>Athanaſius: And it could not be expected that</hi> Julian <hi>ſhould countenance the beſt, when</hi> Conſtantius <hi>had done ſo much againſt them, and got moſt of the Churches headed with</hi> Arian <hi>Biſhops.</hi> So that <hi>Julian</hi> maintained divers of the Leaders of the <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> as his Favourites and Penſioners, to balance the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> that they might be in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>hurry,</hi> and find no <hi>eſtabliſhment,</hi> but <hi>ſuffer as evil doers,</hi> and the <hi>cauſers of Diviſion,</hi> when they onely aſſerted the <hi>Evangelical Doctrine,</hi> as well againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> as <hi>Pagans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rogatianus</hi> and <hi>Pontius,</hi> two <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> in a Petition of theirs to <hi>Julian,</hi> ſtile him <hi>the onely Aſſertor of publick libertie, from whom alone Juſtice and Clemencie could be hoped for.</hi> Than which flatteries.

The <hi>Catholicks</hi> wondered (as well they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96115:40"/>might) that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſhould be ſo ſhort-ſighted, as not to perceive that <hi>Julian</hi> was ſtriking at the very root of Chriſtianity; of which they often minded them, and gave them this plain Demonſtration: <hi>That by the ſame Edict by which they were indulged, the Worſhip of Idols was injoyned;</hi> and the Devil and they were let looſe together, to compaſs the Earth, and make Proſelytes to their Party. <hi>Tunc reddidit (Julianus) Baſilicas Donatiſtis, quando Templae Daemoniis,</hi> Aug. Epiſt. 166. Optatus, l. 2. p. 54. <hi>Eo modo putans Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nomen de terris poſſe perire, ſi unitati Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae de quâ lapſus fuerat, invideret, &amp;c. haec erat ejus praedicanda juſtitia.</hi> Yet when <hi>Julian</hi> was dead, and <hi>Jovian</hi> a <hi>Catholick</hi> Emperour ſucceeded, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> bewailed his death, and often wiſhed that their good Protector were alive again: <hi>Julianum ab inferis excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retis.</hi> St. <hi>Aug. ubi ſupra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the third particular, it would fill a Volume to acquaint you that Outrages were committed by the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> upon the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> during <hi>Julian</hi>'s Reign: I ſhall onely name one or two, that may parallel thoſe which were committed by the <hi>Pagans.</hi> The firſt ſhall be from <hi>Optatus,</hi> p. 55. <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius,</hi> two <hi>Donatist Biſhops</hi> came to the Caſtle of <hi>Lemelle,</hi> where the <hi>Catholicks</hi> had a Church; which being ſhut againſt them, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96115:40"/>the Rabble that followed them to pull it down: who preſently got upon the roof and uncovered it; and perceiving the Deacons defending the Altar, they threw down the Tile-ſtones, and ſlew two of the Deacons in the place. In <hi>Thypaſia</hi> a Citie of <hi>Mauritania, Albanius Formenſis</hi> and <hi>Felix Idicrenſis,</hi> with their bloudy Companions, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted an Aſſembly of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> while they were at their Devotions; and driving them out of the Church, ſlew and wounded a great part of them, without reſpect of Sex or Age: The Bread of the Conſecrated Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt they threw to their Dogs; which having eaten it, by the Judgment of God grew mad, and fell on their Maſters, renting ſome of them in pieces: They ſold the Conſecrated Chalices to Women for vile uſes, or to the Heathen for the ſervice of their Gods; pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Altars; and burnt the books of the Holy Scriptures. <hi>Felix</hi> one of their Leaders deflowered a Virgin that had a little before owned him for her Spiritual Father. None of the Heathen committed greater Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages than ſome of their Biſhops. And by their inſtigation, <hi>Julian</hi> ſhut up their Church-doors. <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperour poſted them for it, and cauſed an Edict to be ſet up in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places as a Memorial, <hi>Quo omnibus inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcat, &amp; Catholicae confidentiae conſtantia, &amp;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96115:41"/>Donatiſtarum deſperatio &amp; fucata perfidia;</hi> of the conſtancie of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in making uſe of <hi>Julian</hi>'s power to oppreſs them. Theſe practices gave occaſion to <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> to ſay, No Beaſts were more cruel to Chriſtians, than they were to one another. And they who ſhall cloſe with Uſurpers and Perſecutors to favour and ſupport their Faction againſt a true Church, deſerve to be ſtigmatized as thoſe Donatiſts were, <hi>In perpetuam rei memoriam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 27. of the Alexandrian Synod, <hi>Zozomen</hi> (lib. 5. cap. 11.) gives us a better account. You are ready to catch at every thing that may make for a Toleration of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and therefore mention their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not to uſe thoſe terms which might puzzle ordinary underſtandings, and not on every occaſion in Popular Orations, but in diſputes againſt the Hereticks that denied the <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> of the Son and Holy Ghoſt. But you omit their confirmation of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which <hi>Zozomen</hi> there names, <hi>(viz.) That</hi> Athanaſius <hi>and</hi> Euſebius <hi>having aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Biſhops of divers Cities, did confirm the Decrees of that Council, and confeſſed that the Son and the Holy Ghost were conſubſtantial with the Father; and theſe they named the Trinity; and that they deſired onely that the words</hi>

                  <p>THis Chapter you ſay contains <hi>the ſenſe of the Primitive Chriſtians about his Succeſſion;</hi> of which you ſpeak, p. 19. under theſe two heads:
<list>
                        <item>1. how the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> ſtood, and</item>
                        <item>2. what <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title Julian</hi> had to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Empire.</item>
                     </list>
This firſt, I confeſs, you have (but againſt your will) clearly ſtated; and it will be enough to diſcredit all that you ſuggeſt concerning the ſecond; which is, That the Chriſtians would have been willing to ſet aſide his Title, and to have excluded him purely for his Religion; which upon your Reaſons I ſuppoſe the <hi>generalitie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> would never have attempted, though <hi>ſome few</hi> might have been willing enough.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, the reaſon you mention from <hi>Euſebius</hi> is, That <hi>the Throne of the Empire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to</hi> Conſtantine <hi>from his Father, and by the Law of Nature</hi> (which is a divine Law) <hi>was reſerved for his Sons and their Poſteritie, and was to deſcend for ever, as another Paternal Inheritance doth.</hi> And that this is the Law of Nature, you confirm from <hi>Eumenius</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96115:44"/>then, (and others) who ſays, <hi>It was not the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual conſent of men, or any ſudden effect of their favour, which made</hi> (Julian) <hi>a Prince; he gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it by being born into the world: which ſeems to me the first and greatest Gift of the Gods.</hi> Now if by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Empire, Julian</hi> was to ſucceed; I cannot ſee how the Chriſtians could by their Principles reſiſt him in the adminiſtration of it, without <hi>reſiſting the Ordinance of God.</hi> For this, I have quoted Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Paraphraſe on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. &amp;c. and that Saying of <hi>Tacitus, That we ought to endure wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as we do Inundations or Scarcitie, which are of Gods ſending.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 20. are <hi>full and pregnant proofs;</hi> and I think, <hi>ad hominem</hi> cogent: for if, as you obſerve from <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the Empire was to deſcend as other Paternal Inheritances, then it muſt be more unlawful to reſiſt or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Prince from enjoying his Inheritance, than any private perſon. And then ſurely no ſound Chriſtian could have joyned in an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs</hi> to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to exclude a perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as it were by the Voice of God, as you ſay of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> that he <hi>was declared abſolute Emperour by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> is often uſed by Greek Authors for <hi>Cuſtom.</hi> And I believe that Father whom you mention, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no more than a Right of Succeſſion for two or three Generations; which carried the name of a <hi>Law,</hi> as it doth alſo in our <hi>Common Law,</hi> where <hi>Conſuetudo Lex est.</hi> And it is well known, that when the Heirs of the Emperors have been living, the <hi>Roman Souldiers</hi> have created their Emperours out of <hi>Obſcure Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies:</hi> but theſe are no Patterns for us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to follow, nor for us in this Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others. For <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror claimed the Crown not ſo much by his <hi>Sword,</hi> as by <hi>Right of Succeſſion,</hi> (if you will believe the Author of that <hi>Fanatical book</hi> called <hi>The Rights of the Kingdom</hi>) to King <hi>Edward,</hi> whoſe <hi>Kinſman</hi> he was, and <hi>his Heir by Will,</hi> as appears by the Laws of St. <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> p. 197. So that in this reſpect the <hi>Deſcent</hi> of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is much more firm and eſtabliſhed than that of the <hi>Empire,</hi> having been continued through more Generations, and confirmed by many Laws, which whoever ſhall infringe, takes off the Government from its Hinges, and leaves all to Confuſion. For when a private Eſtate is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96115:45"/>intailed on a man and his Heirs, it is neceſſary that to bar the Heir, and alienate the Eſtate, the original Intail muſt be cut off, and then he that is in poſſeſſion may diſpoſe of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to one or more. And perhaps this was the intent of the <hi>Bill for Excluſion,</hi> to make it an Act for the <hi>Diſſolution of Monarchy,</hi> and reduce us to a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> again. And it were better we ſhould ſuffer <hi>ſome Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies</hi> (if the Will of God be ſo) which yet are uncertain, than againſt the Will of God to do things unjuſt, and draw more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain troubles on our own heads. For in the Conteſt between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> when the firſt alway pleaded the <hi>Right of Deſcent,</hi> the other alleadged the <hi>Acts of Parliaments;</hi> there were infinite troubles, which coſt the lives of above 200000 men, whereof eight were Kings and Princes, forty Dukes, Marqueſſes and Earls, beſides Barons and Gentlemen; and after all, the Kingdom fixed on this Maxime, <hi>Jus Sanguinis nullo Jure dirimi poſſit, i. e.</hi> The Right of Bloud cannot be abrogated by any Law. And the Author of <hi>the Rights of the Kingdom</hi> ſays, that in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third and <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, when was a motion of ſome <hi>great men</hi> that a <hi>Baſtard</hi> might inherit, the Parliament at <hi>Merton</hi> cried out, <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,</hi> p. 264. Therefore I wonder that the

                     <hi>ſame Author,</hi> p. 98. making a Suppoſition. That if any <hi>one man</hi> of all the <hi>Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ſhould uſurp the <hi>Crown</hi> with all its dues: (He mentions not the <hi>whole Houſe,</hi> for that hath been done already) <hi>What ſhould I? what may I do?</hi> (ſaith he) and anſwers, <hi>Nothing, but mind my Calling, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Judgment of the highest Court that I know, that may command my Body and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much.</hi> It is a Maxime in our Law, That <hi>the King never dies:</hi> The King and his Heirs are looked on in the eye of the Law as an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual;</hi> and to prevent <hi>Tumults</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,</hi> they are joyned in moſt of thoſe Acts that concern the Dignity of the Crown and publick Peace; and the Son hath ſometime been Crowned in his Fathers life-time. Yet we plead not <hi>Providence</hi> in the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> nor the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> upon which for other matters you lay the ſtreſs of your whole Diſcourſe; but upon the <hi>Law of God,</hi> Deut. 17.8. where it was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>Statute of Judgment,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſay <hi>Fagius</hi> and <hi>Munſter, a firm and immutable Law,</hi> and as the Vulgar, <hi>Sanctum Lege perpetua</hi>) That <hi>IF A MAN DYE WITHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T CHILDREN, THE INHERITANCE M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST BE GIVEN TO HIS BRETHREN.</hi> And <hi>Ainſworth</hi> from <hi>Solomon Jarchi,</hi> ſays, <hi>The Brother of him that was dead, or his Brothers ſeed, ſhall inherit.</hi> All
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96115:46"/>this hath been obſerved by the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> where Kingdoms are hereditary, That as it is unjuſt, ſo it hath been always unhappie to alter the Succeſſion; and even in private e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, the diſinheriting the right Heir hath been very much condemned and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And yet,</hi> (p. 22. you ſay) <hi>the Fathers had the Conſcience to ſet aſide ſuch a Title.</hi> They could not do it with a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> the thing being in it ſelf <hi>evil:</hi> for as the Law of God forbids to <hi>countenance a poor man in his Cauſe,</hi> ſo doth it alſo to defraud the rich, or <hi>follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> neither to <hi>ſpeak in a cauſe to decline after many to wreſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> None of us would judge it reaſonable to be deprived of his right contrary to Law; and why then ſhould we think it lawful to deprive another of that right to which we owe the preſervation of our own? <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> more clearly ſhews what was the conſent of the Fathers in this caſe: <hi>We pray for your Empire, and that the Son, as it is juſt, may ſucceed in his Fathers Throne.</hi> And yet they both were Pagans. But what would the Conſent of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the ſenſe of the <hi>primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> ſignifie againſt the <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Heaven?</hi> who cannot more plainly declare his will to us, than by the voice of Nature, by his written Word, by pointing out, as by his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96115:46"/>finger, in his Providence, in making <hi>Heirs to Kingdoms</hi> as well as <hi>other Eſtates</hi> by a long and legal diſcent: and, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, <hi>God that gave the Empire to good</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>gave it alſo to</hi> Julian.

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet all this Crack of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> and (p. 31.) <hi>the whole Chriſtian world,</hi> produceth nothing but <hi>a flaſh of Rhetorick</hi> from an <hi>Invective</hi> in <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> againſt <hi>Julian;</hi> from which if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the <hi>ſame Author</hi> in a more <hi>temperate</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Zeal,</hi> when he delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dogmatically to the people committed to his charge, we ſhall find him teaching and exhorting a <hi>different Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> from what is here delivered by him: of which I ſhall ſpeak at large hereafter; and onely note by the way, That the <hi>Oration</hi> was made long after <hi>Julian</hi>'s death: which ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not very much of <hi>humanity;</hi> and if it were upon occaſion of ſome diſappointment, as is reported, it had as little of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And this will appear a truth, that he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as well in the praiſe of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the firſt <hi>Arian Emperiour,</hi> as in the diſpraiſe of <hi>Julian,</hi> and the miſrepreſentation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in his time. All which circumſtances
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96115:47"/>conſidered, and no other proof produced, our Authour deſerves to do <hi>publick Penance</hi> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> and, as he ſaies, <hi>the whole Chriſtian world.</hi> And yet what can <hi>Gregory</hi> blame in <hi>Constantius,</hi> but that which he calls his <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake?</hi> not being aware of his Apoſtacie. And it was too unchriſtian to blame the Emperour not onely <hi>for making him a King,</hi> but <hi>keeping him alive. This</hi> (you ſay, p. 24.) <hi>is enough to ſhew that</hi> Conſtantius <hi>would never have made</hi> Julian Caeſar <hi>if he had known him to have been ſuch.</hi> And, in my judgment, here is as much ſaid to prove that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ought to have ſlain him when his Brother <hi>Gallus</hi> was ſlain; Although this was a thing which he repented of in his Death-bed, and would undoubtedly be more unworthy of a <hi>Christian Emperour</hi> to exclude him out of the <hi>life,</hi> than to leave him to a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> that deſcended by inheritance to him. And if it be ſuch <hi>a Bill of Excluſion</hi> that you contend for, I am ſure none of the <hi>Fathers</hi> nor any <hi>good Christian</hi> would ever conſent to it.</p>
                  <p>P. 24. Is an Exclamation againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, having firſt ſaid that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> did far <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all other Kings in Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> p. 25. and that he was <hi>led by the Hand of God into every Counſel and Enterprize</hi> (what, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Arian,</hi> and perſecuting <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <hi>Orthodox Biſhops,</hi> and putting <hi>Arians</hi> in their ſeats?) <hi>your wiſdom was admired above your power, and again your power more than your wiſdom: but your Piety was valued above them both.</hi> Then he comes to blame the Emperour as the onely ignorant and <hi>inconſiderate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> — and <hi>which of the Devils ſtole in along with you at that Conſult?</hi> And yet again, <hi>p.</hi> 26. he ſaies of this firſt <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour, That <hi>he would have parted not onely with his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and all that he had in this world, even his Life it ſelf, for the ſecuritie and ſafetie of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> &amp;c. And our Author ſaies, that at his death he <hi>ſhewed with much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs the concernment he had for the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> p. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>But for ought I yet ſee, <hi>Julian</hi>'s Apoſtacie was not yet known, but he was generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted both a <hi>pious</hi> and a <hi>ſtout</hi> man; and therefore his repenting of making <hi>Julian Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was not on the account of Religion, but for ſome other reſpect, <hi>Julian</hi> having been declared <hi>Auguſtus</hi> by his Souldiers, who often diſpoſed of the Empire, and being then on his march to diſpute the Title with <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> (for hitherto <hi>Julian</hi> kept to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies, and was not known to be a Pagan, as you ſhew from <hi>Ammianus Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> p. 28.) <hi>After that</hi> Julian <hi>was declared Emperour, he ſtill feigned himſelf a Chriſtian;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96115:48"/>and though in private he performed his Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rites, truſting ſome few with the ſecret, yet he publickly went to Church on</hi> Twelfth-day; <hi>and after he had been devout at the Service, he came away again. This was done at</hi> Vienna, <hi>not quite Ten Moneths before the Emperour's death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is all that our Author produceth for the ſenſe of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> for the Excluſion of <hi>Julian;</hi> his <hi>Title</hi> was <hi>divine,</hi> his <hi>Religion</hi> at moſt <hi>onely ſuſpected,</hi> not know.

                  <p>THe Reader may underſtand that our Author hath done with <hi>Julian</hi> as a <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> and now ſhews how the Chriſtians treated him when he was in <hi>full poſſeſſion</hi> of the Empire, and that <hi>by Divine Appointment</hi> (as he grants). And therefore I hope it will be conſidered, that the following <hi>Reflections</hi> do ſhew, from the practice of the Chriſtians of <hi>that Age,</hi> how the Chriſtians of <hi>this</hi> may behave themſelves towards their lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours. And he begins, <hi>p.</hi> 32. with a <hi>great varietie of Inſtances,</hi> as he calls them, <hi>of the hatred and contempt of thoſe Chriſtians towards</hi> Julian. And I ſhall alſo deſire that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will conſider not onely the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> but the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of ſuch <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> as were ſpoken and done againſt <hi>Julian. A facto ad jus non valet argumentum.</hi> And then by what <hi>number</hi> of Chriſtians, and of what <hi>condition</hi> they were that ſpoke and acted ſuch things as were ſpoken and acted: For we have known in our Age ſuch things ſpoken
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96115:50"/>and done, by no ſmall companie of men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Prince of known Integrity, as will make all <hi>ſober Chriſtians</hi> to be <hi>aſhamed</hi> and <hi>confounded</hi> at the report of them. And if ſuch behaviour of our <hi>preſent Chriſtians</hi> ſhall be a hundred years hence read in our <hi>Annals,</hi> it will be a grand Calumnie againſt ſuch as were more <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Pious,</hi> for any Reader to conclude that ſuch was the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Chriſtians in that Age; or that becauſe <hi>one diſcontented Biſhop</hi> turn'd Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and fought againſt his Prince, <hi>that all the Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then alive were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</p>

And if the Chriſtians were <hi>first in the Tranſgreſſion,</hi> it was not like <hi>Julian</hi> would be long behind them, or be leſs <hi>barbarous</hi> than they. And yet though he could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged himſelf with the <hi>Sword,</hi> he did it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the <hi>Pen:</hi> And when he was put into a fit of anger, he onely told them as a

                  <p>P. 36. You give a particular inſtance of <hi>a ſingle man in</hi> Berea, whoſe <hi>Son warping to the falſe Religion, his Father turned him out of doors and diſinherited him; who related this whole matter to the Emperour, then coming to</hi> Berea. <hi>The Emperour being arrived, invited among other Magiſtrates and Chief men, this young man and his Father, and ſet theſe two next himſelf; and tells the Father, that in his mind it was not just to force a mans Judgment otherwiſe inclined, to reduce it to the other ſide: Therefore don't you</hi> (ſaies <hi>Julian</hi>) <hi>force your Son against his mind to follow your Opinion; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I force you to follow mine, though I could eaſily compel you. The Father ſharpning his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with a Divine Faith, anſwered,</hi> O King, do you ſpeak of this Villain, who is hated by God, and hath preferred a Lye, before the true Religion? <hi>But ſaies</hi> Julian, <hi>putting on a vizard of Meekneſs again,</hi> Friend, leave railing; <hi>and turning to the young man, ſaid,</hi> I will take care of you my ſelf, ſince I have not prevailed with your Father to do it. This <hi>Berean</hi> deſerves
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96115:52"/>the Title of <hi>Noble</hi> for his <hi>Zeal;</hi> but it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to a demonſtration of what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it for, <hi>p.</hi> 35. that the Chriſtians took the freedom to <hi>reproach him and his Religion to his face:</hi> for though he deſpiſed his <hi>Religion,</hi> yet for ought that appears, he owned his <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and reverenced his <hi>Perſon,</hi> beſpeaking him by the Title of <hi>O King.</hi> And here is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for <hi>railing words,</hi> neither from that <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Berean</hi> againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> nor from <hi>Julian</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>P. 38. you give another inſtance of <hi>Maris</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon, who being blind, was led to the Emperour as he was Sacrificing to Fortune,</hi> for which he called him <hi>Impious Apostate,</hi> and <hi>Atheist;</hi> and Julian <hi>reproached him again with his blindneſs,</hi> ſaying, <hi>his Galilaean God would not cure him. Maris</hi> replied, <hi>I thank God for ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me with blindneſs, that I may not ſee thy face.</hi> This was bold and well; for he refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not on his <hi>Perſon,</hi> but his <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> The ſayings of <hi>Juventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> you think fit to omit; but I ſhall ſhortly mind you of them. It is ſtrange that our Author could find no inſtances more <hi>pertinent</hi> to his purpoſe than <hi>theſe two,</hi> wherein (as he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 45.) they <hi>ſhewed themſelves to be men of like paſſions with other men:</hi> though neither of them ſhewed themſelves to be men of a <hi>capricious humour,</hi> but declaring their <hi>just indignation</hi> againſt his

                     <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> yet ſpared his <hi>Perſon</hi> and his <hi>Office;</hi> as knowing that they <hi>ought not to ſpeak evil of the Ruler of the People,</hi> though they were ſuch as had been <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> and <hi>cauſed them to be ſmitten contrary to the Law,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us; much leſs when they onely ſmite us with their <hi>tongues,</hi> as <hi>Julian</hi> did in the caſe alledged. And if it were done in <hi>paſſion,</hi> as you intimate, you know how our Saviour condemned that in his <hi>own Diſciples</hi> that would <hi>call for fire from Heaven on the</hi> Samaritans.</p>
                  <p>Now againſt the <hi>ſpeaking evil of Dignities,</hi> which <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 8. ſharply reproves in the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> of his time, I ſhall produce the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of <hi>other eminent Christians,</hi> even in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> Reign. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was a great <hi>Pillar of the Church</hi> at that time, and a great example of <hi>paſſive Obedience</hi> under the ſevere Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Julian;</hi> yet he <hi>gave his Oath</hi> that he never ſpake evil of him, as you ſhall hear anon. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpake of the ſame times, The Chriſtian <hi>Ledentibus non iraſcitur, Spoliantibus non reſistit, caedentibus non repugnat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lactantins</hi> lived ſomewhat ſooner, but ſhews the practice of Chriſtians in his time, which was under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximian,</hi> the two greateſt Tyrants: <hi>Cum tam nefanda perpetimur, NE VERBO quidem reluctamur, ſed Deo remittimus ultionem,</hi> Inſtit. l. 5. c. 21. and the ſame patience he ſays was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96115:53"/>practiſed every where; <hi>That though they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured unſpeakable miſeries, yet none of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did reſist, ſo much as in a word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>P. 38. <hi>It would be endleſs</hi> (you ſay; that is, it would not be to your end and intent) <hi>to reckon up the Sayings of Juventinus</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus;</hi> which you name again, <hi>p.</hi> 39. but wiſely paſs by. For they being accuſed for ſpeaking againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> by ſome ſuch Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as your ſelf, do without any maledictions thus plead for themſelves: <hi>We, O Emperour, who were brought up in the true Religion, and have lived in obedience to thoſe excellent Laws made by</hi> Conſtantine <hi>and his Sons, cannot but greatly lament to ſee all things defiled with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie</hi>—<hi>our Meats and Drink are polluted.</hi> (The Emperour had cauſed ſome of the Water, or the Sacrifices offered to his Gods, to be mixt or ſprinkled with their Meat; which did not hinder the moſt Chriſtians from uſing them, according to what the Apoſtle allowed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.): But do they rail or rebel? No: they are Lachrymiſts; <hi>Thoſe things</hi> (ſay they) <hi>cauſe us to ſhed many tears at home, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us to make our ſorrowful complaint before thee.

                  <p>The <hi>next Inſtance</hi> is from a paſſage of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen,</hi> of which this is a brief account. <hi>Who is there to be found that more deſpiſed the Emperour, or had a greater hand in deſtroying him, than my Father? Of his contempt, amongst many others, both thoſe Archers and THEIR COMMANDER are a proof, whom HE BRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT against our Church, as either to take poſſeſſion of it, or to deſtroy it: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſaulted many others; he came hither like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the ſame intent, and imperiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Temple. He ſo far failed of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing any thing of what he deſired, that if he had not preſently got out of my Fathers way (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aware of it, either of himſelf, or by ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies advice) he might have gone away kicked; the Biſhop boyling with Anger against him, and with Zeal for the Temple.</hi> A very hot fit of <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> together, it muſt needs be, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96115:54"/>did animate ſo <hi>ancient a Biſhop</hi> (being ninety years old) to <hi>lift up his heel</hi> againſt <hi>a young Emperour</hi> of thirty two, in the head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who having aſſaulted many <hi>other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> came reſolved to ſeize <hi>this</hi> alſo.

                  <p>You adde, <hi>p.</hi> 44. <hi>And now I know no more than the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>what to make of all this;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96115:56"/>what they meant by it, or on what Principles they proceeded.</hi> I queſtion not the Principles of thoſe in whom you have inſtanced; it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth me that you ſay it was done <hi>in a fit of boiling anger.</hi> But when, ſpeaking of the Principles of ſuch as offer violence to their lawful Emperours, you ſay <hi>you know nò more than the Pope of</hi> Rome: I ſay, it is pity that you ſhould know or divulge half ſo much: For what you have ſuggeſted concerning theſe pretended Violences offered by Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians to their lawful Emperours, hath a very malign influence on the preſent Age; and for this and other ſuch Reaſons, (as I ſaid) I would rather loſe my right hand than be the Author of them. But if you know their Principles as well as the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> you know he holds it lawful to depoſe or kill any <hi>Prince</hi> whom he ſhall judge and Excommunicate as a <hi>Heretick</hi> or Tyrant; and he can teach you to diſtinguiſh between reſiſting <hi>Julian,</hi> and reſiſting the <hi>Devil that was in him:</hi> That the King is <hi>

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96115:56"/>yet others, conſidering you ſpeak of <hi>Julian,</hi> who was now a lawful Emperour, may ſtretch this line too far. <hi>Scotland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath been glutted with <hi>the bloud of their Kings;</hi> whereof about Thirtie have ſuſſered violent Deaths.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96115:57"/>Emperour:</hi> And if, as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſays, <hi>fama apud graves &amp; bonos viros,</hi> is a proof of Treaſon, I fear an Indictment may lie againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Life; for that— <hi>Not having the fear of God before his Eyes, but being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>THis was indeed the <hi>Devotion</hi> of our late <hi>Times,</hi> to begin with a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> not regarding the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or as much as the <hi>Commandments, Creed,</hi> or <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> and then to <hi>preach</hi> in their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> in their <hi>Preaching;</hi> or, if you will, in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Language, <hi>to ſay their Prayers back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> In their Devotions, you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 45. <hi>It might be expected we ſhould ſee the flights of their ſelf-denying and ſuffering Religion; and one may expect they ſhould lay aſide their annimoſitie against</hi> Julian, <hi>though he were their Ememie, and for that reaſon pray the harder for him.</hi>— This certainly was their <hi>duty,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might have ſhewn themſelves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed:</hi> But this, our Author thinks, was fit onely for the Chriſtians in <hi>Diocleſians time,</hi> and thoſe that lived in the <hi>moſt Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times.</hi> I am as ſure that they uſed the <hi>right method</hi> of Devotion in praying for their <hi>Heathen Perſecutors,</hi> as our Author can be of what he ſeems to glorie in, that theſe in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96115:58"/>time <hi>prayed the wrong way, p.</hi> 46. <hi>They cannot ſing a Pſalm</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>but they make his Confuſion the burden of it.</hi> Such <hi>Pſalms</hi> as theſe, are none of the <hi>Songs of Sion,</hi> which ſhould make for <hi>Peace;</hi> nor had he the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Solomon that compoſed them, or they the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> that ſung them. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> (as we read) <hi>ſung a Hymn</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Paſſion; but it was not for <hi>confuſion</hi> of thoſe that came to apprehend and crucified him; he prayed for them: <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi> &amp;c. Now though the <hi>Brethren of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land bave been ſilent of late, yet among the <hi>Siſters</hi> there are many ſuch <hi>ſweet Singers</hi> ſtill, who in their <hi>Rhapſodies</hi> dart up <hi>Arrows, Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> againſt Heaven it ſelf; which have deſervedly recoiled on their own heads, and ſpoiled their ſinging. And if ſuch be their <hi>running Verſes,</hi> and the <hi>Burden of their Songs,</hi> ſing <hi>Quicunque vult</hi> for me; I will be none of that <hi>black Quire:</hi> St. <hi>Stephens</hi> example is fitter for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who prayed for his Perſecutors while they were ſtoning of him, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge, Acts</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 60. And all ſober Chriſtians will rather take St. <hi>James</hi> his advice than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Julian,</hi> who tells us, if we uſe our Tongues to <hi>bleſs God even the Father,</hi> and to <hi>curſe men which are made after the ſimilitude of God,</hi> (and Princes have a <hi>double Image</hi> of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96115:58"/>God; as they are <hi>Men,</hi> and as they are <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>) if we are <hi>double-tongued,</hi> and <hi>out of the ſame mouth proceeds bleſſing and curſing: my brethren</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>theſe things ought not ſo to be,</hi> James 3.9, 10. And now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Proofs. And firſt, as to the inſtance of thoſe who <hi>removed the Bones of</hi> Babilas; it was ill done to ſet <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi> to the tune of <hi>Sheba</hi>'s <hi>Trumpet, We have no portion in</hi> David, <hi>neither have we any inheritance in the Son of</hi> Jeſſe: <hi>Every man to his Tents, O Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Doubtleſs, they ſhould rather have prayed for his <hi>Converſion</hi> than his <hi>Confuſion.</hi> How unſuitable was this to the Funeral-So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of a <hi>Martyr,</hi> when they ſhould have rather <hi>bleſſed God for the example of the Faith and Patience of</hi> Babilas, than have provoked the Emperour to have made it <hi>their own Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-dirge!</hi> Our Saviour adviſed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to <hi>flee from perſecution,</hi> not to <hi>draw it on their own heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond inſtance, is of <hi>Publia</hi> and her Maidens, who ſung <hi>to the ſame tune,</hi> and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what St. <hi>James</hi> preſcribes; having <hi>praiſed God her Creator,</hi> by and by, in a fit of <hi>Rage,</hi> whereof (you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 50.) <hi>there ſeemed to be ſome quantitie,</hi> ſhe turned her Devotion into Curſes <hi>plainly levell'd at the head of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian: And it is a wonder, that having to do with <hi>ſuch an Emperour,</hi> that they had not like
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96115:59"/>
                     <hi>Swans</hi> ended their <hi>Lives</hi> with their <hi>Songs.</hi> But did any <hi>companie of Chriſtians</hi> at that time meet ſolemnly together, and make uſe of ſuch a <hi>Directorie</hi> for their <hi>publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> No; they were but the <hi>paſſionate acts</hi> of <hi>a few private perſons,</hi> contrary to the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> as ſhall moſt undeniably appear anon. But this calls to my mind a more rude and barbarous behaviour of <hi>ſome</hi> (who accounted themſelves the <hi>best Chriſtians</hi>) towards the <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> who honouring one of their Congregations with his preſence, when they came to ſing a Pſalm, by whoſe inſtigation it was I know not, the 52 Pſalm was named, and <hi>begun</hi> to be read:
<q>
                        <l>Why doſt thou Tyrant boaſt abroad</l>
                        <l>Thy wicked works to praiſe?</l>
                     </q>
Whereat the good King lifting up himſelf, ſaies, I pray you to ſing the 56 Pſalm,
<q>
                        <l>Have mercy, Lord, on me, I pray,</l>
                        <l>For man would me devour.</l>
                     </q>
And the Congregation cheerfully ſung with his Majeſtie. <hi>This was one great fault</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the Common-prayer, that it taught them to pray ſo often for me; to which prayers they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96115:59"/>had not loyaltie enough to ſay</hi> Amen. It is a moſt <hi>profane Cuſtom,</hi> though it hath of late years been too much in uſe, to turn our <hi>Prayers</hi> into <hi>Satyrs,</hi> and our <hi>Pſalms</hi> into <hi>Paſquils</hi> and <hi>Libels;</hi> and to <hi>vomit forth our Spleen,</hi> when we ſhould <hi>pour out our Hearts</hi> before God.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> his anſwer to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> when he had been accuſed for ſtirring up <hi>Conſtans</hi> againſt his Brother <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to reſtore him by Arms. <hi>I am not ſo mad, O Emperour, that you ſhould ſuſpect me to have had any ſuch thought. I call God to witneſs against my Soul, and I ſwear, the Lord can bear me witneſs, and his Anointed your Brother, I never mentioned you for any evil before your Brother; neither ever ſtirred him up againſt you, as theſe</hi> (Arians) <hi>ſlander me: but whenever I had acceſs to him, he himſelf mentioned your gracious inclination; And God knows what mention I made of your godly diſpoſition. —I am not ſo mad, neither have I forgotten the voice of God, which ſaith,</hi> Curſe not the King in thine heart, nor the mighty in the ſecret of thy chamber; for the birds of the air ſhall reveal it, <hi>&amp;c. If the things ſpoken in ſecret touching you Princes cannot be hid, is it likely that I in the preſence of a Prince, and many ſtanding by, would ſay any thing of you otherwiſe than what was good? —I beſeech your Highneſs call to mind my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96115:60"/>when you admitted me to your preſence at</hi> Vimimachum, <hi>at</hi> Caeſaria, <hi>and</hi> Antioch; <hi>whether I did ſo much as offer an evil word of</hi> Euſebius <hi>my bitter Enemy, or of any my perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: And if I refrained my tongue when I was to plead against them in my own defence, what madneſs had it been to traduce an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour before an Emperour, and to ſtir up one Brother againſt another?</hi> Athanaſii <hi>Apol.</hi> ad Imperatorem <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> Yet was this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop turn'd out of his Church without <hi>kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperour,</hi> or any <hi>Officer of his,</hi> as may be there read: he departed peaceably; and though the Citizens were ready to take Arms on <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his behalf, he pacified them and departed.</p>

                     <hi>How great proviſion of Armour and inventions of Engines; how many myriads of men and armed Souldiers could effect thoſe things which we by our Prayers onely,</hi> and God <hi>by his Will hath done?</hi> Nor is it probable that the Chriſtians at that time did want force to reſtrain the violence of the Emperour, ſeeing our Author confeſſeth, that <hi>he who though it a ſmall buſineſs to conquer the</hi> Perſians, <hi>thought it a great work to reduce the</hi> Chriſtians.

                  <p>This conſideration, drew from the Learned <hi>Mountague</hi> upon the relation of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) this Note; <hi>It was not becauſe they could not, but becauſe they would not reſiſt:</hi> for they had ſtrength ſufficient to have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Tyrant, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> declare: The Chriſtian intereſt was ſo largely propagated, and had taken ſuch deep roots, that it could not be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> unleſs the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had periſhed with it. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, the Chriſtians were <hi>pars pene major cujuſque Civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, &amp; veſtra Omnia implevimus;</hi> And if they had but deſerted the Empire, it would have been as a Wilderneſs: Yet it appeared to be true, That <hi>Chriſtianus nullius est hoſtis nedum Imperatoris.</hi> And St. <hi>Cyprian ad Demetr. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo noſtrum quando apprehenditur reluctatur, nee ſe adverſus injuſtam violentiam veſtram, (quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis nimius &amp; copioſus ſit populus noster) ulciſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.)</hi> But thoſe <hi>Christians</hi> had learn'd pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the School of Chriſt, as well by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96115:61"/>as precept; and not to overturn and bring all to confuſion, with a
<q>Flectere ſi nequeo ſuperos, Acheronta movebo.</q>
So the Learned <hi>Mountague.</hi> So that when <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, <hi>they had no other defence, but all was cut off from them,</hi> he may be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, concerning the uſe of any other means, all violence and reſiſtance being forbidden them; for, <hi>id poſſumus quod Jure poſſumus:</hi> they were forbid to uſe the Sword for revenging themſelves upon the Emperour. And St <hi>Gregory</hi> in his 1. <hi>Orat.</hi> ſays, <hi>that the enemy of Christianity was defeated by Gods mercy, and the Christians tears, which were many, and ſhed by many,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, as they wanted not <hi>Souldiers,</hi> ſo neither valiant and experienced <hi>Captains</hi> that had the entire affections of the Souldiers, and which were approved <hi>Chriſtians. Jovianus, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> (which three after the death of <hi>Julian</hi> were ſucceſſively choſen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours) could each of them have engaged Legions to follow them: and how well the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were affected to them, you have ſeen already by their choice of <hi>Jovian</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the death of <hi>Julian.</hi> So that it might be as truly objected that they wanted <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>Commanders,</hi> as that they wanted <hi>Arms,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96115:62"/>Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Fortreſſes.</hi> They had not indeed <hi>ſuprized</hi> any of the <hi>Imperial Forts,</hi> or held them out in <hi>actual Rebellion</hi> againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> (as you know who did in the <hi>laſt Age:</hi>) but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were Gariſoned with <hi>Chriſtian Souldiers,</hi> who doubtleſs would have declared for the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> againſt the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi> of <hi>Julian,</hi> had not theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Confeſſors</hi> been reſtrained by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt to <hi>fear God and honour the King,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, I have two other Conſiderations of great weight with me, that it was not for <hi>want of Strength,</hi> or <hi>doubt of Succeſs,</hi> that the Chriſtians did not oppoſe <hi>Julian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As firſt, it was uſual with the Roman Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers upon any diſguſt with their Emperours, to kill their Emperours, and ſet others in their Thrones. Six of the twelve <hi>Caeſars</hi> were ſlain, pas ſome Hiſtorians account; but never was there ſuch a thing done by the <hi>Chriſtian Souldiers:</hi> For after ſuch time as the Roman Strength was put into the hands of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they never depoſed any one of their Emperours, though there wanted no <hi>Strength</hi> on their parts, nor <hi>Provocations</hi> on their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies part, many of them being Perſecuting <hi>Arians.</hi> And though <hi>Julian</hi> by his raſhneſs, againſt the advice of <hi>Salluſtius,</hi> a man of great experience, and generally beloved of his whole
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96115:62"/>Army, was reſolved on the <hi>Perſian War,</hi> and had fooliſhly expoſed them to great hazards and danger, by his following the directions of a Renegado <hi>Perſian,</hi> who led them into a barren, and almoſt inacceſſible Country, and burning his Ships that might have ſerved for a retreat; yet was there no <hi>Aſſociating</hi> or ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt him in his life-time; but as ſoon as he was dead, they all profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians, and choſe a Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The power which the Clergy had with the People, who could hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain then from tumults and fighting in their deſence, is another Argument with me: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at that time <hi>Athanaſius</hi> convened in the great City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a great number, not onely of the Biſhops of the Greek Church, which were near at hand, but from <hi>Italy, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Libya;</hi> which argues that the affairs of Chriſtianity were in no low or deſpiſable condition. And if it be true that <hi>Gregories</hi> Father <hi>alone</hi> thought of braving the Emperour, what might the <hi>united Intereſt</hi> of theſe Biſhops and the Souldiery in their Sees have done? But they thought it better to flee as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did, or betake themſelves to their Spiritual Armory of <hi>prayers and tears,</hi> than to lift up a hand againſt <hi>Julian.</hi> And I cannot but think that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> was of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96115:63"/>ſame Judgment, when he wrote without any paſſion to the Citizens of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being affrighted with the noiſe of Perſecution, in his 17th <hi>Oration,</hi> to this effect: <hi>(N. B.) this is one of our Laws, and of thoſe laudable ones moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ordained by the Spirit of God, who knew beſt how to temper his Law with a mixture of what was poſſible to us, and honeſt in it ſelf, That as Servants ſhould be obedient to their Maſters, and Wives to their Husbands, and the Church to our Lord, and Diſciples to their Paſtors and Teachers: So ſhould we alſo be ſubject to all</hi> higher powers, not onely for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo for. Conſcience ſake. St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> alſo in a Funeral-Oration, n. 20. for St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,</hi> records an Anſwer of his to <hi>Modeſtus</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Country under <hi>Valens</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour— <hi>Where the Cauſe of God is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, we neglect other things, and look onely to him: Fire, Sword, and Beaſts, are matters of rejoycing to us, rather than terrour: Reproach, threaten, and do to us what thou pleaſeſt, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy thy Authority, let the Emperour alſo hear of this; Thou ſhalt not overcome nor perſwade us to conſent to Impiety.</hi> So that both <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> the Divine, and <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great, which were no <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> but <hi>Great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> of the Church, were for the preſcription of <hi>prayers and tears,</hi> although you would force them to the contrary.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:96115:63"/>
                  <p>I have reſerved another Teſtimony of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> for this place, being an account of the <hi>Publick Prayers</hi> made by himſelf for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> the Emperour, though he had reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him from his Paſtoral charge. In his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie to <hi>Conſtantius. Witneſs hereof</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is first the Lord, who heard us, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto you the intire Empire, which was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by your Anceſtors; then thoſe who at that time were preſent: for the words I uſed were theſe onely;</hi> Let us pray for the welfare of the moſt religious Emperour <hi>Conſtantius; and the whole People with one voice cried preſently,</hi> O Chriſt, be favourable to <hi>Conſtantius; and ſo continued praying a long time.</hi> And then he concludes, <hi>Let truth take place with you, and leave not the whole Church under a ſuſpition, as though ſuch things</hi> (as tended to the death of <hi>Conſtans) ſhould be thought on or written by Chriſtians, and eſpecially by Biſhops. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was alſo accuſed for celebrating Publick Prayers in the Church of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> which he confeſſeth he did, being urged thereto by the importunity of the People; that they might pray for the welfare of the Emperour in that Church which he himſelf had builded, being ready otherwiſe to go out of the City, and to aſſemble themſelves in the Deſarts. But thus he expoſtulates with the Emperour: <hi>And you, O King, most beloved of God, where
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96115:64"/>would you have had the People ſtretch out their hands and pray for you? there where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans did paſs by, or in the place which bore your name, and which from the first foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all men did call a Church?</hi> And then he prays thus for the Emperour—<hi>O Lord Chriſt, who art indeed King of kings, the onely begotten Son of God, the Word and Wiſdom of the Father; becauſe the People have implored thy goodneſs, and by thee called upon thy Father, who is God over all, for the welfare of thy most religious ſervant</hi> Conſtantius, <hi>I am now accuſed.</hi> And then ſpeaking to the Emperour, <hi>You do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, but are willing that all men ſhould pray, knowing that this is the Prayer of all, that you may live in ſafetie, and continually reign in peace.—And as for you, O Emperour, beloved of God, many years I pray you may live, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the Dedication of this Church: for thoſe Prayers that are made therein for your welfare, do no way hinder the ſolemnitie of the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And whereas <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was accuſed alſo for not obeying the Emperours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to depart from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he ſays, <hi>I do not oppoſe the Command of your Majeſtie; God forbid; I am not ſuch a man as would oppoſe the very Treaſurer of the Citie, much leſs ſo great an Emperour.— I was not ſo mad as to oppoſe ſuch a Command of yours: I neither did oppoſe it, nor will enter into</hi> Alexandria, <hi>until you of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96115:64"/>your humanitie be pleaſed I ſhall ſo do.</hi> If <hi>old Gregory</hi> was of another mind, it was but <hi>one Doctors Opinion.</hi> And I think our Author in the ſame caſe is a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> from all <hi>Chriſtian Divines,</hi> as well as from the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and from Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> too, who ſaies, that <hi>hurtful prayers and deſires are ſeldom from God:</hi> and he ſpeaks it in the very caſe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> p. 17. of his <hi>Direct.</hi> part 4.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96115:65"/>by his hand or weapon, but with fastings and continual watchings, and remaining under Gods Altar, by his Prayers prevailed with God to be a Defender both of him and his Church.</hi> I will give you St <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his own words to his Church at <hi>Millain:— I will never forſake you willingly; being conſtrained, I know not how to make oppoſition.</hi> Dolere potero, potero flere, potero gemere adverſus arma Milites Gothos; Lachrymae meae arma ſunt; talia enim mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimenta ſunt Sacerdotis; aliter NEC DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEO NEC POSSUM RESISTERE. <hi>I can ſorrow, I can weep, I can ſigh against Arms, Souldiers, and Goths; Tears are my weapons; for ſuch is the Munition of a Priest; in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner I O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT NOT, I CANNOT RESIST.</hi> And his People were much of the ſame mind, as he deſcribes it, <hi>Epist.</hi> 33. or as in ſome Editions, the 13. <hi>Ad Marcellinam, What could have been better ſpoken by Chriſtian men, than that which the Holy Ghost ſpake in you this day?</hi> Rogamus, Auguſte, non pugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, <hi>We entreat, O Emperour, we fight not; we are not afraid, yet we entreat.

But there is no Law of God for <hi>reſiſtance</hi> of a lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. The Apoſtle did not calculate his Doctrine for the three firſt Centuries under Heathen, and that it ſhould expire under Chriſtian Magiſtrates: the Spirit of God foreſaw that <hi>Kings ſhould be nurſing Fathers</hi> to his Church, and made good Laws for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie thereof; but he never meant that Princes ſhould be reſiſted, though in ſome things they ſhould act contrary to thoſe Laws.</p>

                        <item>2. By the Laws of our Country too: for though by the favour of Chriſtian Princes many good Laws are made for obedient Subjects, which the Prince may not violate without his great ſin againſt God; yet hath the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

                  <p>P. 93. Our Author, by way of Poſtſcript, tells us, he hath <hi>many more exceptions against the Artillery of Prayers and Tears, than he can ſtay to inſist on.</hi> The firſt is a great excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed, which makes St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all that our Author had quoted from him; for St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> p. 57. of the <hi>first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective</hi> (<hi>Eaton</hi>-edition) ſays thus: <hi>Julian was hindered by the goodneſs of God, and the Tears of Chriſtians, which were ſhed in great plentie by many who had this onely remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Perſecutor.</hi> Now it is well obſerved by our Author, here are <hi>no Prayers mentioned;</hi> none at all for his <hi>confuſion,</hi> no ſuch Prayers as <hi>are no better than Treaſon by our Law,</hi> p. 95. Secondly, <hi>Gregory</hi> doth not tell us here that they had no <hi>Arms,</hi> or <hi>Walls,</hi> or that theſe <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymiſts</hi>

                  <p>P. 96. Our Author parallels theſe Prayers with ſome, which he ſays were <hi>made Treaſon in Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s days,</hi> of which the Act ſays, (<hi>Anno</hi> 1. and 2. of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> lib. 9.) <hi>That ſome prayed that God would turn her heart from Idolatrie to the true Faith, or elſe to ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her days, or take her quickly out of the way.</hi> Though they had uſed ſuch Prayers in <hi>ſecret,</hi> they ſhould methinks for their own ſakes have for born them in their <hi>Conventicles,</hi> where the Act ſays they were uſed, and where (as you would have it) ſuch <hi>murdering Prayers</hi> are too frequent in our Age. And I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God might not have rejected ſuch Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with a <hi>Quis requiſivit?</hi> I believe verily it was never in our Saviour's mind, when he bids us to <hi>pray for them that perſecute us;</hi> nor of his Apoſtle, when he injoyns that <hi>Prayers and Supplications,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be made for Kings and all that are in Authoritie,</hi> 1 Tim 2.1. And whereas that Act ſaith, <hi>Such a Prayer was never heard or read to have been uſed by any good Chriſtian
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96115:67"/>man against any Prince, though he were a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan;</hi> you think you have given preſidents for it in the caſe of <hi>Julian,</hi> where the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians prayed for his <hi>Deſtruction, not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> If (as you ſay) you <hi>pray as hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his R. H. as any man, in the Collect for the Royal Family,</hi> you cannot but mind his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And no preſident that ever I heard of will warrant any other Prayers, but to this effect: <hi>END<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E THEM WITH THY HOLY SPIRIT, INRICH THEM WITH THY HEAVENLY GRACE, PROSPER THEM WITH ALL HAPPINESS, AND BRING THEM TO THINE EVERLASTING KINGDOM,</hi> &amp;c. Here is nothing at all for <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> but all for <hi>Converſion.</hi> And though I know you are a <hi>daring man,</hi> yet pray do not think of reforming the <hi>Engliſh Liturgie</hi> by your <hi>Julian</hi> nor <hi>Gregorian</hi> Account, and teach us by your example to <hi>ſay our Prayers back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>

                     <hi>Sigebert,</hi> in his <hi>Chron. ad Anno</hi> 1088. tells us, That <hi>this noveltie, that I ſay not Hereſie, was not yet riſen up in the world, that the Prieſts of God (who ſaith to a King Remove, and maketh an Hypocrite to reign for the ſins of a people) ſhould teach the people that they owe no ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to wicked Kings; and though they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an Oath of Fidelity to them, yet they owe no Fidelity to them; nor are to be accounted perjured, though they fight againſt them; and that he that obeyeth the King ſhall be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96115:69"/>and he that oppoſeth him ſhall be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from the guilt of Injuſtice and Perjurie.</hi> So that although theſe <hi>Ancient Biſhops</hi> were <hi>never in</hi> Scotland, yet a man may think our <hi>Scotizing Presbyters</hi> have been at <hi>Rome;</hi> whoſe <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> run ſuch <hi>paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels,</hi> as would ſill a bigger Volume than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96115:71"/>to his horſe, he cried out, <hi>He that raiſed me up is fallen;</hi> and as the Hiſtorian ſays, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius died at that very time.</hi> But the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt Scene is behind, <hi>p.</hi> 58.

                  <p>The manner of his death our Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, <hi>p.</hi> 59. as an uncertainty, but jumps in his Opinion with the Heathen <hi>Libanius,</hi> that <hi>he who killed him was a Chriſtian,</hi> although I have quoted two Authors who aver that it was done by the hand of an <hi>Enemie:</hi> Yet to ſerve his Hypotheſis, that <hi>it is lawful for a Chriſtian to kill a Heathen Emperour,</hi> he will needs caſt it on the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>

                  <p>Yet our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 60. ſays, Truly <hi>this is a ſtrange conceſſion: but that which we may more wonder at, is, that</hi> Zozomen <hi>ſhould juſtifie ſuch a traiterous Aſſaſſination, as he doth (in theſe words,</hi> p. 60.) <hi>It is not improbable that ſome one of the Souldiers might take into conſideration
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96115:72"/>how the Heathens and all men to this day do ſtill praiſe thoſe who long ſince have killed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, as men that were willing to die for the Common Libertie, and defended in that manner their Country men, Kinſmen, and Friends: and you can hardly blame him who ſhews himſelf ſo courageous for God, and for that Religion which he approves;</hi> in <hi>Zozomen</hi>'s words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>JUlian<hi>'s Perſecution was but a Flea-biting to what the Chriſtians formerly felt; a ſhort and weak aſſault of the Devil;</hi> ſo that <hi>if any fell from Chriſtianitie, they were ridiculouſly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome; and if they perſevered, it was no great matter to loſe a Trade or Profeſſion for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; — and this was the greatest ſeveritie</hi> (ſays our Author) <hi>of all</hi> Julian<hi>'s Edicts.— To ſpeak properly, he was rather a Tempter than a Perſecutor; ſeducing ſome with Money, others with Places of Trust and Honours of all ſorts; others by the witchcraft of his words, and by his own example.—And as for what he deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Chriſtianitie, it was far ſhort of what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperours had executed.</hi> So far our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whom I muſt name, leſt you ſhould not think it his: For how could the man of <hi>ſuch a Character</hi> deſerve all thoſe <hi>virulent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> (of which before) or thoſe <hi>rudeneſſes</hi> of ſome Chriſtians which follow in our Author? <hi>p.</hi> 66. <hi>How do the Chriſtians treat this Emperour, reproaching him, ruffling
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96115:74"/>with him, vexing every vein in his royal Heart, ſaying all their Prayers backwards, calling down vengeance upon his head, dancing and leaping for joy at his death, and inſulting over his memory; calling him by the bloudieſt names of the Devil!</hi> P. 67. and (pray mark them, they are our Authors words) <hi>But for he name of Chriſtians, he had better fallen among Barbarians.</hi> And would our Author have theſe to be examples for <hi>true Proteſtants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But doth not our Author alſo ſay his leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>backward,</hi> and write a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> Or is it his meaning, that if a Prince incline (though but a little) to <hi>Tyranny</hi> or <hi>Irreligion,</hi> it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe him as <hi>thoſe Chriſtians</hi> did <hi>Julian?</hi> He doth plainly at once Calumniate the <hi>whole body of Chriſtians</hi> and their <hi>Teachers</hi> in that Age, from the miſ-behaviours of a few; and ſeeks to <hi>debauch</hi> the preſent Generation, which are <hi>too bad</hi> already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Julian</hi> taught better Doctrine to them that were his Chriſtian Subjects, (though he did it ſpightfully— <hi>Not to avenge themſelves, not to go to Law, nor render evil for evil, but pray for and wiſh well to their perſecutors</hi>) than you do for their behaviour towards their Princes, and that ſpightfully enough: for this (as you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) <hi>is a right courſe to gloſs away all their duty, and to break all the meaſures by which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96115:75"/>all the Ancient and Suffering Chriſtians have gone in all former perſecutions.</hi> And doth it become a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or a <hi>Divine,</hi> one that would be numbred among the more <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>ſtricter</hi> ſort of his Brethren, to vent ſuch things? What? to deride the <hi>prayers and tears,</hi> the <hi>faith and patience</hi> of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> and to applaud the <hi>inſolencies</hi> and <hi>extravagancies</hi> of the ſeditious Rabble? Let me whiſper it ſoftly in your ear: I think <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apoſtate did leſs prejudice the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, than ſuch a one as <hi>Lucian</hi> the Scoffer. Mr. <hi>Baxter, Chriſtian Direct.</hi> p. 20. <hi>I do not think</hi> Nero <hi>or</hi> Diocleſian <hi>martyred near ſo many, as the People turned looſe would have done. Much more was</hi> Julian <hi>a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Church from popular rage,</hi> &amp;c. And you ſhall ſooner waſh a <hi>Black-more white,</hi> than cleanſe your ſelf from that <hi>Contagious Leproſie</hi> which over-runs your whole <hi>Book:</hi> (and I pray God it hath not ſeized on your <hi>Heart</hi>), which you do in vain endeavour by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe; which I now conſider.</p>
                  <p>P. 68. you ſay, <hi>The truth of the Matter is this: Their caſe differed very much, and they were in quite other circumſtances than the firſt Chriſtians were. When</hi> Julian <hi>came to the Crown, he found them in full and quiet poſſeſſion of their Religion, which they had enjoyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption for almoſt fifty years, and which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96115:75"/>was ſuch an ineſtimable bleſſing, that they had plainly undervalued it, if they had not done their utmoſt to keep it: and then to have this treaſure wreſted out of their hands by one bred up in the boſom of the Church, who profeſſed himſelf a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and never pull'd off his Maſque till it was too late for them to help themſelves; this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to raiſe not onely all their Zeal, but all their Indignation too.</hi> Your <hi>almost</hi> ſaves your computation of <hi>fifty years</hi> wherein the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians enjoyed a full and quiet poſſeſſion of their Religion without interruption, from a great Untruth: for it was a good while after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the Empire, that he did or could ſhew any great favour to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, he being brought up under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and not being baptized himſelf until towards the end of his Reign. That he baniſhed <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> the great Pillar of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not to be denyed; nor that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was himſelf an <hi>Arian,</hi> and promoted thoſe deſtructive errours in ſuch a manner, as that the Orthodox Biſhops whom <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had baniſhed, and were recalled by <hi>Julian,</hi> ſeemed to be in a better condition under him than under <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> many Biſhops being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for refuſing to ſubſcribe againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> and his <hi>Creed</hi> in the Council of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain:</hi> And <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> with many others of his perſwaſion, lived in deſart places until the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96115:76"/>death of <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> So that though the fifty years did run out at length; yet in all <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his time, which was reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty years, the Orthodox were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily afflicted by the <hi>Arians, Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcellians.</hi> And you may as well ſay the Church of <hi>England</hi> had a full and quiet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Religion without interruption in the times of our late Confuſion, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Muſhrome-Sect</hi> ſprung up above it, as that it was ſo with the Primitive Chriſtians during the time of <hi>Constantius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might add much more; but deſire the Reader to be ſatisfied with that one inſtance of the <hi>Arians</hi> dealing with old <hi>Hoſius</hi> a Biſhop of a hundred years old; whom in a Council of theirs at <hi>Sirmium</hi> they ſo tormented, that they forced him to ſubſcribe to them to ſave his life. And how ill it was with others, even in the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſee the Hiſtory of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> lately printed.</p>
                  <p>But then for <hi>the poor Primitive Chriſtians of all, they were born to Perſecution; they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew better, nor expected it— The Laws of the Empire were alwaies in force againſt them— their Religion at best was in the world but upon ſufferance, as</hi> Abraham <hi>in the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>where he had no Inheritance, no not ſo much as to ſet his foot on. But as his afflicted Poſteritie were afterward Lords of that Country, ſo after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96115:76"/>Egyptian Bondage, Chriſtianitie was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be the eſtabliſhed Religion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> All this, and much more, is but Mr. <hi>Hunts</hi> Argument in other words: for p. 46. he ſays, <hi>The Reformed Religion hath acquired a civil Right, and the protection of Laws: if we ought not to loſe our Lives, Liberties and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but where forfeited by Law, we ought much rather not to loſe them for the profeſſion of the beſt Religion, which by Law is made the publick National Religion. And it is ſtrange that ſome men of the ſame Religion in profeſſion, can think (that notwithſtanding) it makes no matter what is done to a man if he be Religious; but if he be not ſo, the leaſt publick injuries and injuſtice may be reſiſted, vindicated, remedied, and by right defended by old Laws, or new ones to be made for that purpoſe. The Chriſtian Religion was publiſht when the whole world was Pagan, and therefore it was ſubmitted to ſuch uſage as the Governours would give it. But when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith had by Miracles of patience declared it ſelf to be of Heaven, according to the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on that behalf, it took poſſeſſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and Crowns and Scepters became ſubmitted to the Croſs; and the Chriſtians acquired a civil Right of protection and immunity, which they ought not, they cannot relinquiſh and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, no more than they can deſtroy themſelves. Such as thus periſh, ſhall never wear a Martyrs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96115:77"/>Crown, but periſh in the next world for periſhin in this. This will be interpretatively Crucifying Chriſt afreſh, after that he is received up into Glory,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>after his Religion is exalted into Dignity, Honour, and civil Authority,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus far <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> are agreed; and theſe were precious hints to <hi>our Julian;</hi> for till he hit on this <hi>new Notion,</hi> there was nothing in the whole Book, that favoured of <hi>Common ſence,</hi> or had any <hi>ſhew of Reaſon;</hi> but his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> miſunderſtand one another; and what one builds up, the other throws down; and after a long evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſmoak and aſhes, and ſometimes fire, (as <hi>ancient Hiſtorians</hi> relate of <hi>Aetna</hi>) our <hi>modern Hiſtorian</hi> makes the ſame Mountain to pour out ſuch a deluge of <hi>Water</hi> as drowns all the Faith and Patience Chriſtian men, and leaves onely <hi>Julian</hi> to triumph at the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>If theſe men be not in too great haſte, and their Guilt and Fears drive them not into Corners, I would expoſtulate with them a while: Can the Laws of men make void the Law of God? and have you Authoritie to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> where the Law of God makes no <hi>diſtinction?</hi> Doth not that ſpeak plain, that we <hi>muſt ſubmit not onely to Maſters that are good and gentle, but alſo to the froward,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.18. and to <hi>Parents that correct us according
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96115:77"/>to their pleaſure: and the believing Wife is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her ſelf to her unbelieving Husband in every thing, Eph.</hi> 5.24. not contrary to Gods Word? and is it not true, that what is ſaid of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Servants, Children,</hi> and <hi>Wives,</hi> the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Subjects?</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirms, after <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> Was a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Emperour to be ſubmitted to <hi>in all things,</hi> and not a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> Shall the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which Chriſtian Princes grant us, be uſed as Weapons to fight and rebel againſt them? Was it lawful for the Catholicks to rebel againſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> when he was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Heretick, and by great violence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted that <hi>damnable Hereſie,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> calls it, ſuppreſſing and baniſhing the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> and ſetting up the <hi>Arian?</hi> Is it not ſaid, that <hi>if we ſuffer wrongfully, (i. e.</hi> againſt Law and Equity) <hi>and take it patiently, this is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy with God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can you without Sacriledge take away the Crowns from all the Martyrs that died ever ſince <hi>Julians</hi> time, and tell us they died like Fools or mad men, and were <hi>felo's de ſe,</hi> for not ſelling their Lives at a dearer rate, and like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> pull down the Pillars of the Empire, with an <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96115:78"/>
                     <hi>he that loſeth his life ſhall ſave it?</hi> If it be unjuſt in the Prince to deprive us of our Rights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of the Land, is it not much more ſo, for us to deprive him of his againſt the Law of God, as well as that of the Land too? And have we not generally (I mean the Clergie at leaſt) Subſcribed, <hi>That it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatſoever,</hi> (not of Religion, nor of the Laws) <hi>to take up Arms?</hi> &amp;c. Non debet minor poteſtas ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſci, ſi major praelata ſit: <hi>The Laws of the Land</hi> muſt give place to the <hi>Law of God.</hi>

                  <p>The contrary to all theſe, are the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Conſequences of your <hi>new diſtinction,</hi> that allows of <hi>Rebellion</hi> when we ſuppoſe the Laws of the Land to be on our ſide: I ſay, <hi>ſuppoſe them;</hi> for Wars have been raiſed and maintained on ſuch a <hi>falſe Suppoſition.</hi> And if when the Prince declares that he <hi>doth and will govern by the known Laws,</hi> we ſhall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that he <hi>doth not,</hi> and ſuggeſt our groundleſs and unreaſonable Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies that he <hi>will not;</hi> who ſhall be Judge in this Caſe? Shall the people take the Sword in their hands to cut this <hi>Gordian-knot,</hi> and cut us all in pieces? We have (God be thanked) many good Laws for our ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a gracious Prince that hitherto hath and will govern by them: but we have one great Law of God, and another of the Land,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96115:78"/>that though he ſhould <hi>not,</hi> yet we may not <hi>rebel.</hi>

                  <p>That <hi>exceſſive commendation</hi> which our Author gives of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> makes me think he hath <hi>exceeded</hi> alſo in the <hi>diſpraiſe</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> p. 70. <hi>Never any man in this world ſet his heart ſo much upon any other thing, as he did to ſee the Chriſtians flouriſh, and to have all the advantages of glorie and power: And neither conquered Nations, nor a well-govern'd Empire, nor great Treaſures, nor exceſſive Glorie, nor being King of Kings, nor all other things which make up other mens notions of Happineſs, did delight him ſo much, as to have the honour of bringing honour to the Chriſtians, and of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them eſtabliſhed for ever in the poſſeſſion of Power and Authoritie.</hi> And yet as it was ſaid of <hi>Naaman</hi> that <hi>mightie man of Valour, But he was a Leper:</hi> ſo it is recorded of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> he was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and perſecuted the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>I think I have ſaid enough already to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the inſignificant Inſtances produced by our Author, when I gave you the <hi>more ſober ſence</hi> of St. <hi>Gregorie</hi> himſelf, of St. <hi>Baſil, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> all which lived when they had <hi>the Laws on their ſide,</hi> and <hi>the beſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world</hi> to defend; and yet they durſt not do it by the <hi>Sword,</hi> if they <hi>could</hi> have done it; for I ſhall not now queſtion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96115:79"/>their <hi>power; Tertullian</hi> did aſſert that of old, and the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> hath put the truth of it out of queſtion, in his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Stephen Marſhal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſays our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 70. <hi>For</hi> Julian, <hi>who by his Baptiſm first, and entring into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders after, and going to Church after that, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently engaged himſelf to maintain Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; to endeavour on the other hand to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs them of their Freehold, is an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table injurie.</hi> It was ſo indeed: and I would have our Author conſider, whether for a man that hath been received into the Boſom of the Church, and hath eaten of her Bread, and approved of her Doctrine, to become an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate from that holy Profeſſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Church and Chriſtianity it ſelf to ſcorn and contempt, be not to out-do <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall deſire the Reader patiently to look on, while I remove thoſe few Blockadoes which our Author hath laid in my way; and then I ſhall attack that <hi>inchanted Caſtle,</hi> wherein thoſe two <hi>Giants</hi> think themſelves ſo ſecure, as to laugh at all oppoſition that can be made againſt them. That of <hi>Juventinus</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi> mentioned a third time in <hi>p.</hi> 72. is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready level'd: if there were a Sham-plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, our Author ſeems to be one of their accuſers for <hi>talking too boldly</hi> againſt the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96115:79"/>Emperour, which they utterly denied. A ſecond <hi>Sham-plot</hi> was of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> p. 72. but I ſee no man concerned in that; neither ſhall I fight with <hi>Shadows,</hi> as our Author doth.</p>
                  <p>P. 73. Old <hi>Bracton</hi> is conjured up; and he preſently flies in the face of the <hi>Conjurers,</hi> and tells them, that <hi>when Laws are made by. the conſent of the people and the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they cannot be altered or deſtroyed without the joynt conſent of all thoſe by whom they were concerned:</hi> And yet the Laws of Queen <hi>Elizabeth for keeping her Subjects in due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> are exploded as ſome of the <hi>Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the Nation. With what face can they plead the Laws of the Land for their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who daily violate and contemn them, and teach others to do ſo?</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>p.</hi> 74. our Author is ſurpriſed with the <hi>Thebaean Legion,</hi> which appeared to him as a Legion of Noon-day Devils; and he wonders who ſhould raiſe them up: he cries out as that Legion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Art thou come to torment us? What have we to do with thee, O</hi> Thebaean <hi>Legion! what have we to do with their Example!</hi> No, I'll warrant my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor he ſhall never <hi>die for his Religion</hi> as they did, he hath parted with that already for fear of what might come. And this <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baean Legion</hi> is ſuch a terrible <hi>immortal Army,</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:96115:80"/>as will defeat all <hi>Rebels</hi> to the worlds end. <hi>Are we</hi> (ſays our Author) <hi>to go to Maſs to morrow, or elſe to have our Throats cut?</hi> No; nor are we to cut our <hi>Princes</hi> Throat to day, for fear leſt he ſhould compel <hi>us</hi> to go to Maſs to morrow. Such fears were as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the daies of <hi>Charles the First,</hi> as of <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> yet we ſee what was then done.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Are we under a Sentence of Death according to the Laws of our Country, if we do not preſently renounce our Religion?</hi> No; but if we preſently renounce our Religion, as <hi>our Author</hi> hath done, and then contrive a <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> we are under a Sentence of a <hi>two-fold</hi> death; one by the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and another by the <hi>Law of Man.</hi> The <hi>Thebaean Legion</hi> ſo frighted our Author, that he cannot get them out of his mind: <hi>Poor men they were!</hi> to ſacrifice or be ſacrificed! They never heard the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> preached to them, but profeſſed another Doctrine which they received according to the commandment of Chriſt, and practiſed after his example, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering patiently for well doing. They <hi>never were in</hi> Scotland, to learn that there was <hi>a reward due to them that ſhould kill tyrannical Princes:</hi> They never had the examples of <hi>a Chriſtians killing</hi> Julian, and being <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> Theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96115:80"/>lights and atchievements were reſerved for <hi>our bleſſed Age,</hi> whereof (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) the Scripture foretold, that <hi>in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days there ſhould be traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God, having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof.</hi> And many ſuch who have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves <hi>good Proteſtants,</hi> have made a ſhift to die in <hi>Rebellion</hi> under the pretence of their <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the comfort is, as our Author ſays, <hi>That can never happen to us, but by our own trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie to our Religion, in parting with thoſe good Laws which protect it, and in agreeing to thoſe that ſhall deſtroy it.</hi> What needs then all theſe <hi>Celeuſma</hi>'s and barbarous clamours of <hi>Ho-up</hi> againſt a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> which may never come; or if he ſhould, can never do us hurt without our own conſent? Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf could not ſo much as out a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Prieſt, till ſhe had procured a Parliament for her turn; and ſtill kept the Church-lands, and by Parliament had the Supremacy ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on her as far as any of her Predeceſſors enjoyed it. And if <hi>ſuch things can never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen but by our treachery in parting with thoſe good Laws as protect our Religion, and agreeing to ſuch as ſhall deſtroy it,</hi> why are we ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with thoſe, whereby that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe-impregnable <hi>Fortreſs</hi> and <hi>Bulwork</hi> againſt

                  <p>P. 76. <hi>It is a general Notion among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that we ought to ſpare our perſecutors, and not ſuffer them to be guilty of Murder:</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory <hi>gives that as a very good reaſon of</hi> Marcus <hi>his flight from</hi> Arethuſa. <hi>Gregory</hi> gives a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon than that, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was moved by that Precept of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.23. <hi>When you are perſecuted in one City, flee ye to another;</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 88. he foreſaw, <hi>that if he had tarried, the people might for his defence have riſen againſt the Officers and Souldiers of the Emperour; and if they had died then, they had been</hi> felo's de ſe. To prevent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction therefore, as well as the guilt of their Perſecutors, he quietly yielded himſelf into their hands; and though he endured
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96115:81"/>great torments, yet, as if he had been a <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> is he as little pitied by <hi>Gregory</hi> as by his Perſecutors: for <hi>Gregory</hi> having noted that this <hi>Mark</hi> was one of them that ſaved <hi>Julian</hi>'s life when <hi>Gallus</hi> was ſlain; <hi>for this one thing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In the ſame <hi>p.</hi> he relates a paſſage of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſlom,</hi> and infers from it, that David <hi>meant no more than onely to prevent the effuſion of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, as appears by the ſeveral opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he had to cut off</hi> Saul, <hi>but the ſenſe of his duty made him to abhor the leaſt thought of it.</hi> This I like ſo well, that I ſhall tranſcribe a little more concerning <hi>David</hi>'s behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Saul,</hi> out of the <hi>excellent Book</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies.</hi> P. 287. <hi>Now let David anſwer to ſuch demands as men deſirous of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion do uſe to make: Shall not we, being ſo good men as we are, riſe and rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Prince hated of God, and Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy? and therefore likely not to proſper either in war or peace? but to be hurtful and pernicious to the Commonwealth?

Shall we not, ſay they, riſe and rebel againſt our known mortal and deadly enemy that ſeeks our lives?

Shall not we aſſemble an Army of ſuch good fellows as we are, and by hazarding our lives, and the lives of ſuch as ſtand with us, and withal hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State of our Country, remove ſo naughty a Prince? No, ſaith godly</hi> David; <hi>for I when I might, without aſſembling force, without tumult, or hazard of any mans life, or ſhedding a drop of blood, have delivered my ſelf and Country of an evil Prince, yet would I not do it. Are not they, ſay ſome, luſty and couragious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that do venture to kill and depoſe their King, being a naughty Prince, and their mortal enemy?

                  <p>Your next Reflection is on the <hi>Pulpit-law</hi> (as you ſay the Lord <hi>Faulkland</hi> called it) of <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> and <hi>complained it had almoſt ruined the Nation.</hi> That noble Lord was indeed a great lover of his Religion and Country, and therefore was an enemy to <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> But when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the outcry againſt <hi>Arbitrarie power</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> was made with a deſigne to graſp it into <hi>other mens</hi> hands; and they began to exerciſe it not onely on the Gentry, Clergie, and Nobility of the Land, but the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily alſo; he repented, and ſo faithfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96115:83"/>to the King in defence of his Authority, that he loſt his life in the Quarrel. It was the <hi>Pulpit-law</hi> in 41. and 42. that deſtroyed us, and brought in Arbitrary Power.</p>
                  <p>But how near doth our Author come to put a <hi>border of Treaſon</hi> on his <hi>impolitick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> p. 78. where he ſays, <hi>The Arbitrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of thoſe times,</hi> (to which both he and Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> impute the beginning of the Late War) <hi>did not bring any great terrour with it; it was then but a Rake, and ſerved onely to ſcrape up a little paltrie paſſive money: But now it is become a Murdering-piece loaden with I know not how many bullets.</hi> Who are they, I wonder, that preach up ſuch an <hi>Arbitrarie Power?</hi> or who are they that make ſuch a <hi>Murdering-piece</hi> of it? Is it not rather a <hi>Fiction</hi> of ſome men, who would find a pretence for a ſecond War?</p>
                  <p>For if, as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> ſays, p. 52. <hi>That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick fear of a change of the Government that this Doctrine</hi> (to wit, of Arbitrary Power before 41.) <hi>occaſioned, and the Diviſions it made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, was the principal cauſe of the Late War,</hi> is it not evident that the ſame fears are now made Panick or Popular, to prepare the hearts of the People for another War? What elſe mean the <hi>bleatings of the Sheep, and the lowing of Oxen?</hi> the <hi>Vulgar Murmurs,</hi> and loud Cries of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> as if it were intended we
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96115:84"/>ſhould be ruled by a <hi>Standing Armie,</hi> and <hi>That his Majeſties Guards are a grievance; That the diſſolution of a Parliament gave us cauſe to fear that the King had no more buſineſs for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments? Hunt,</hi> p. 22. and <hi>p.</hi> 60. of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>That Parliaments ſhould ſit till they have done that for which they were called,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſays our Author in his Marginal Note) <hi>till all Grievances are redreſſed, and Petitions anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And then for ought I know, they might ſit for ever, and ſo no more need of a King. What means the <hi>denying him a Supply,</hi> when <hi>Tangier</hi> was like to be loſt? and not onely with-holding their <hi>own,</hi> but denying him to diſpoſe of his <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Revenues</hi> for his juſt occaſions? What mean our new <hi>Aſſociations</hi> and <hi>Bandying</hi> into <hi>Parties,</hi> and advice even to the Clergie, <hi>not to ſuſpend all the legal ſecuritie they have upon the life of our preſent King? Hunt,</hi> p. 49. All theſe ſtrongly argue that they have a ſuſpition of <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and that, by our Author's confeſſion, was in 41, (and therefore may be ſuſpected to be made uſe of now as) an <hi>incitement to Rebellion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though our Author (<hi>p.</hi> 78.) confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, That <hi>the malignitie of this Doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcovered under his Majeſties gracious Reign;</hi> yet he thinks fit to put him in mind of the <hi>Securitie</hi> he hath given the Nation by <hi>his Coronation-Oath, which all Proteſtant Princes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96115:84"/>value &amp; look upon as Sacred; and likewiſe of many gracious Promiſes that he will govern according to Law.</hi> All this caution argueth more than <hi>Suſpition,</hi> it looks like an <hi>Accaſation;</hi> though I know no defect, but the neglect of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Laws againſt Tranſgreſſors. <hi>But if it do not fall out in his Majeſties Reign, it will appear in its colours, and we may feel the ſting of it, if it pleaſe God ſo ſharply to puniſh us for our ſins, as to let us fall under a Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,</hi> p. 78, 79. We have (I confeſs) deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch a puniſhment, for kicking againſt our Proteſtant Princes: but by the bleſſing of God, we may not have ſuch a One: <hi>For who ſhall be King or Queen of this Realm of</hi> England <hi>hereafter</hi> (you tell us) <hi>none but God himſelf knows,</hi> p. 21. of the <hi>Preface.</hi>

That <hi>it can never happen but by our own Treacherie,</hi> &amp;c. Such a formidable Perſecution as you ſuggeſt, is a thing impracticable, and morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: it hath never yet been acted by any Prince, Papiſt or Heathen: the <hi>Marian</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt did not ſo deſtroy <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though it had been but newly planted, but in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign it grew up again, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

                  <p>But ſuch ſuppoſitions as our Author makes, ought not at all to be ſuppoſed: for <hi>there is greater hurt to be feared from them,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Faukner</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 545. of his <hi>Chriſtian Loyaltie</hi>) <hi>than from the thing ſuppoſed; ſince it is much more likely that ſuch deſignes ſhould be imagined and believed to be true, when they are falſe (as they were in the unjuſt Outcries against our late gracious Soveraign) than that they ſhould be certainly true: And every good man, yea every reaſonable man, may have as great confidence that no ſuch Caſe will really happen, as can be had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the future ſtate and condition of any thing in this world.</hi> For which he there gives many Reaſons, to which I refer the Reader, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>

                  <p>P. 82. Old <hi>Bracton</hi> appears again, and is made to eat his own words: for whereas he had ſaid of the King, That <hi>every one is under him, and he under none but God; and that he can have no equal in his Kingdom; for ſo he ſhould loſe his command, becauſe one equal hath no power over another:</hi> now he is made to contradict himſelf, That <hi>Rex eſt ſub lege, quia lex facit Regem,</hi> &amp;c. which is utterly falſe, not onely becauſe the Kings Predeceſſors came in by Conqueſt, but alſo becauſe it is the <hi>Royal Aſſent</hi> that paſſeth all <hi>Bills</hi> into <hi>Laws.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> anſwers this, p. 14. part 4. of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

                     <hi>I congratulate your Vertue, moſt worthy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Souldiers, that for the love of Religion the Command of</hi> Caeſar <hi>wrought no fear at all in you. You have ſeen your Fellow-Souldiers, in a manner with rejoycing minds, to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to a glorious death. How did I fear lest any of you, as it was eaſie for armed men to do (under pretence of</hi> Defence) <hi>ſhould by lifting up his hands give interruption to their moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Funerals? I had now readie at hand for the forbidding this attempt, the Example of our Chriſt, who by the Command of his own mouth</hi>—
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96115:93"/>Put up thy Sword which was unſheathed by his Apoſtle: <hi>teaching thereby, that the Vertue of Chriſtian-Confidence is greater than all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: here Chriſt our God did clearly Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit our minds and hands, that none with mortal hands ſhould reſiſt the Divine Work, but rather with ever-continued Religion add a conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the work begun. Hitherto we have read examples inſerted into the Holy Scriptures, but even now we our ſelves have beheld whom we ought to imitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Maximian</hi> having commanded a <hi>ſecond decimation</hi> of thoſe that remained, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which it is likely that <hi>Mauritius</hi> ſuffer'd) <hi>Exuperius</hi> taking the Enſigns of his Legion, ſpake thus:</p>

                     <hi>My moſt worthy Fellow-Souldiers, I hold as you ſee the Enſigns of a ſecular warfare; but to thoſe Arms I provoke you not: I excite not your Courage and Valour to ſuch wars as theſe; another kind of fight is to be choſen by us. It is not by theſe Swords that you can make your way to the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>We are thy Souldiers indeed; but withal, Gods Servants: to thee we owe our imployment in the War, to him our Innocence; from thee have we received the reward of our labour, to him we are beholding for the beginning of our life: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96115:94"/>ſo follow thee in this, though our Prince, as to deny God who is our Maker, and, whether thou wilt or wilt not, is thine alſo— As for us, even this neceſſitie of our Life doth not drive us to Rebellion— Deſpair it ſelf, which moſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth men in dangers, hath not been able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to arm us against thee. Behold, we have our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and yet reſist not, as willing rather to die than overcome; and chuſing rather to periſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, than live Traitors. If to what thou haſt already decreed againſt us, thou wilt add more, be it Fire, Torture, or Sword, we are ready for it. WE ARE CHRISTIANS;</hi> and ſuch as our ſelves we cannot perſecute. <hi>Conſider, O</hi> Caeſar, <hi>the courage of this Legion: our Weapons we caſt away, and thy Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall find our hands unarmed, but our breaſts armed with the Catholick Faith.

                  <q>
                     <p>My dearly beloved Brethren, fellow-Souldiers and fellow-Saints, we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hazzarded our Lives under a <hi>Pagan</hi> and Tyrannical Prince, who hath employed us as a <hi>Forlorn Hope</hi> on all deſperate deſigns, purpoſely to deſtroy us; and though he be drunk with the bloud of our Brethren now ſpilt before our Eyes, yet doth he thirſt after ours alſo, having appointed us as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sheep for the Slaughter. Hearken, my beloved, the Kings of the Earth ever were, and ever will be, Enemies to the King of Heaven: It is not I, but the Spirit of God by <hi>David</hi> tells you, <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take Counſel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against the Lord, and against his Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> but the ſame Spirit tells us, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>he hath ſet his King upon the holy hill of</hi> Sion, who ſhall <hi>break the Kings of the Earth with a Rod of Iron, and daſh them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel;</hi> and his Saints ſhall have the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>binding their Kings in Chains, and their Nobles with Fetters of Iron.</hi> Moreover, Brethren, we read how in old time, for the ſake of his Elect, God <hi>reproved Kings, ſaying, Touch not mine Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96115:95"/>and do my Prophets no harm.</hi> It is true, that God hath appointed Government as his Ordinance, but he hath not tied us up to <hi>Monarchie,</hi> which all the Wiſe men of <hi>Greece</hi> have rejected, and called them all by the name they deſerved, <hi>Tyrants.</hi> And though our Emperours came in upon us by Conqueſt and Surprize, yet we have been governed heretofore by a <hi>Senate;</hi> and ſometime the <hi>Senate,</hi> and ſometime the <hi>Souldiery</hi> have cut off their Emperours for their Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſet up others in the room. So that if we grant the Office to be from God, yet the perſon appointed to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is <hi>a Creature of man,</hi> or <hi>a Humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and they that ſet them up, may pull them down; for they are appointed to be <hi>a terrour to evil-doers,</hi> and <hi>to be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God to us for our good:</hi> But when he is a Murtherer of them that do well, as we ſee by this bloudy Execution on our Fellow-Souldiers, he is the Devils Miniſter, not Gods; and in reſiſting, we fight not againſt him, but <hi>the Devil that is in him.</hi> Beſides, that which this Tyrant intends, is ſuch an arbitrary Act of his own, that the great Senate, whoſe Counſel and Authority he hath rejected, are afraid of the like cruelty, and would be glad to be reſtored to their Authoritie. Let us therefore be no longer
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96115:95"/>
                        <hi>Servants</hi> of ſuch <hi>men,</hi> but <hi>ſtand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free:</hi> Hath not he made us his <hi>Firſt-born, higher than the Kings of the Earth?</hi> Are not we <hi>a Royal Prieſthood?</hi> and have not the Saints a promiſe that <hi>they ſhall inherit the Earth?</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> may permit Kings to <hi>exerciſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over them, but it ought not to be ſo with us,</hi> 'Tis in vain to expect till the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours become Chriſtians; we Chriſtians muſt make our ſelves Emperours; at leaſt we may divide the Empire among us, and ſet up Chriſt alone to rule as King in the midſt of us, in a HOLY COMMON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEALTH. And now is the time, or never: If we ſhould tamely ſubmit to the Tyrants Sword, our Religion, which is bound up in our Lives, will periſh with us, and the Generations yet unborn will curſe us. Did not <hi>Moſes ſlay the</hi> Egyptian <hi>that aſſaulted his Brother?</hi> and were not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to kill the Canaanites?</hi> What if ſome one of our number, who undervalues his Life, go and diſpatch the Tyrant? <hi>Melius pereat unus quam unitas:</hi> you <hi>Romans</hi> know my meaning.</p>
                     <p>Once more, my Brethren, there is a Law and dictate of nature that will juſtifie us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting thoſe that would take away our Lives. <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> is a Law above any humane
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96115:96"/>Conſtitution. <hi>By what Law muſt we die,</hi> that have the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> for our Self-preſervation, which is <hi>equivalent to the Law of God?</hi> And did not <hi>Cicero</hi> that great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-man tell us, that <hi>Salus Populi Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema Lex?</hi> If thoſe Infidels that are appointed to cut our Throats will venture their Lives for ſuch an Earthly Maſter, ſhall we lay them down cowardly without doing any thing for our Heavenly Maſter, for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which he hath intruſted us with, and will require it at our hands, if we betray it, and ſeek not to convey it to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? And if we die without endeavouring it, we may <hi>periſh in the next world for peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing</hi> ſo tamely <hi>in this.</hi> And thus I hope I have ſatisfied all ſcruples of Conſcience. And now, I beſeech you, ſuffer a word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>Now is the time that God will <hi>redeem his People</hi> by our hands. Now is the time that we muſt vindicate our Chriſtian Liberty. Now is the time that we muſt deſtroy thoſe Romiſh Wolves that would devour the Flock of Chriſt. What though we be in our ſelves but few in number? Were not the people ſo by whom God delivered <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Gideon?</hi> What though our Enemies be many? hath it not been known, when <hi>one hath chaſed a Thouſand,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96115:96"/>and two put ten thouſand to flight?</hi> and may not the <hi>Roman Valour,</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Arm of Chriſt,</hi> do more than the <hi>Jewiſh?</hi> Beſides, though there be but this one Legion that are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians, there are infinite numbers ſcattered up and down the Empire, whoſe hearts are ASSOCIATED with us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and wait for ſuch an opportunity as our ſtout reſiſtance will give them. Did not <hi>Pliny</hi> complain to <hi>Trajan,</hi> that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies were ſo great, that their Heathen Temples were quite forſaken, <hi>Et ſacra Solennia diu intermiſſa?</hi> Did not <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> many years ſince tell us, that the Cities and Gariſons, and Camp, were filled with Chriſtian Souldiers? and are there not great numbers multiplied now, and ready to joyn with us? And a later Doctor, <hi>Cyprian, a holy Martyr,</hi> told us, that our number is <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius &amp; Copioſus:</hi> and the numbers of ſuch faithful brethren are much encreaſed rather than diminiſhed, ſince that time. Be ſtrong then, and couragious; be not afraid nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, for <hi>Maximian,</hi> nor all the multitude with him: <hi>there are more with us than there are with him: With them is the Arm of fleſh, with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battels. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p then and be doing, ye mightie men of Valour;</hi> fight the Lords bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and he will fight for you. Do not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96115:97"/>baſely caſt away your lives like ſo many <hi>felo's de ſe;</hi> ſell them at as dear a rate as you can. It better becomes the Roman Valour to dye like men in defence of their lives and Religion, than ignominiouſly to have their throats cut like ſo many Swine by a bloudy Butcher: If we periſh in ſuch a glorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpize, yet we ſhall live in the records of the Ages to come, and give the world a good example: but if we ſurvive, we ſhall enjoy the honours and glories of the world; Religion will flouriſh with us, and the Church here on Earth be like that in Heaven, no more Militant, but Triumphant.</p>

                  <p>Such have been the Harangues of <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in our <hi>latter Age,</hi> and by them they have led on a multitude to <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and to ſuch an end our Author hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the example of the <hi>Julian-Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there was not one of theſe Worthies <hi>(of whom the world was not worthie)</hi> durſt mutter a ſyllable to ſuch a purpoſe; they <hi>had not ſo learnt Chriſt,</hi> as to ſcandalize and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame him and his Doctrine, as if they were enemies to <hi>Caeſar: We are Chriſtians</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we have Chriſts Example before our eyes to teach us Obedience and Patience, and his Command not to unſheath our Swords againſt lawful Authoritie, neither in our own or his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. We value not the honours of this life,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96115:97"/>but haſten to the glories of a better; and in confidence of a ſpeedie enjoyment of them, we will not make reſiſtance, nor accept deliverance by any ungodly act. And though we ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Crueltie before our eyes in the death of our Brethren that have been cut aſunder and ſlain with the Sword, we are readie to ſuffer as patiently, as we hope to reign gloriouſly with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let any ſerious man among us judge which were the beſt Chriſtians; theſe <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Worthies,</hi> who often took their lives in their hands to fight the battels of a <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Emperour,</hi> and patiently laid them down at laſt, rather than make reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; or thoſe <hi>Modern Zealots,</hi> who will hazard their lives againſt a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prince,</hi> and by their reſiſtance, rather take away his life, than live in obedience to him, or ſurrender their own into the hands of <hi>God that gave it,</hi> when God calls for it?

                  <p>We never heard that the Chriſtians in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s time pleaded the Laws for their indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: Nor had they any ground ſo to do more than the <hi>Thebaean Legion</hi> had. For,</p>

                  <p>Therefore the <hi>truth of the matter</hi> is this: Our Author had committed an errour in the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and now is forced to patch and daub for hiding of it; He ſuppoſeth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in <hi>Julian</hi>'s time did generally do or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what he repreſents ſome few of the weak and ungovernable part to have done; the contrarie whereof, as to the ſounder, more learned, and pious bodie of the Chriſtians of that Age, hath been ſufficiently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>So that I ſhall now appeal to the <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and to the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> (if it be not <hi>ſeared</hi>) whether this be not the <hi>plain truth of the matter</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. The Primitive Chriſtians, for the firſt 300 years, abounded in Chriſtian ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie; they never reliſhed the pleaſures of the World; Ambition and Covetouſneſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſſeſt nor adulterated their ſpirits; the Bloud and Spirit of Chriſt and his Apoſtles ran warm in their Veins, and leapt for joy, as brisk as generous Wine, when it was poured out, for the Goſpel ſake, to bear witneſs to the truths thereof. Then it was that they were <hi>afraid</hi> to <hi>ſpeak evil of Dignities</hi> in the Church or State: then it was ſaid, <hi>Ecce quam ſe invicem diligunt!</hi> Behold how they love one another! Then it was that ſuch <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:96115:99"/>that betrayed any truth of the Goſpel, or any of their Fathers or Brethren, were branded with the black character of <hi>Traditores</hi> or Traitors. If ever we will learn puritie of Doctrine, or innocencie of Life, we muſt take our meaſures from the Example and Practice of <hi>thoſe Primitive times,</hi> whenas yet they had ſo many Apoſtolical Guides among them, that ſealed their Doctrine with their bloud, as <hi>Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp, Juſtine Martyr, Irenaeus,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore we of all others ſhould abhor the Doctrine of <hi>Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> on pretence of the <hi>Laws,</hi> when our Laws ſay, <hi>We may not reſiſt under any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, is not this the <hi>truth of the matter,</hi> that when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> eſtabliſhed the Church in outward ſplendour, and Chriſtianitie was the way to Preferment and Secular honours and advantages, <hi>Hodie Venenum infuſum est Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſioe?</hi> From thenceforward the ſins of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Emulation, and Contention, imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and poiſoned their Spirits; they grew wanton, and began to vex and diſquiet their Governours; to ſupplant, <hi>bite and devour one another.</hi> And <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf favoured the Cauſe of <hi>Arius.</hi> But when <hi>Conſtantius</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed and made it the eſtabliſhed Religion, then, like <hi>Jonas</hi> Gourd, <hi>Arianiſm</hi> and <hi>Donatiſm</hi> ſprung up in a night, and over-topt the whole
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96115:99"/>Church: <hi>Totus mundus miratur ſe factum Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum.</hi> Then it was that Chriſt was crucified afreſh indeed, when his <hi>Deity</hi> was openly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſputed, and thoſe few Chriſtians that with <hi>Athanaſius, Baſil, Apollinaris,</hi> and ſome others, defended it, were baniſhed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Impoſtors, and Seducers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and dealt with accordingly.</p>
                  <p>And from hence moſt probably it was, that <hi>Julian</hi> firſt learnt the Principles of his Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which were improved by the Pagan Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that were his Tutors, who could diſprove the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt</hi> from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Arians,</hi> that were the greateſt part of <hi>Profeſſing Chriſtians;</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> made uſe of ſome of their Arguments againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, concluding, that <hi>if he were not God, he ought not to be worſhipped.</hi> And that Apoſtate often expreſſed a greater favour to <hi>Arius,</hi> and particularly to <hi>George</hi> an <hi>Arian Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> whoſe writings he made uſe of againſt the Chriſtians, <hi>ut Eccleſiam ſuis configeret telis,</hi> than to any of the moſt pious &amp; learned Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Julian</hi> perceived that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contention of Chriſtians was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, that his giving them the reins would be a means to deſtroy them, without his uſe of the Sword or Whip to drive them on (as <hi>when the dogs and wolves had declared war, the wolves ſent a ſpy to diſcover their numbers,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96115:100"/>who brought word their number was great, but their colours were divers, and they did ſo ſnarl and quarrel with each other, that they were not to be feared at all.</hi>) But though <hi>the truth of the Matter</hi> appears, yet we are not come <hi>to the root of the Matter,</hi> (for that is not grounded on <hi>Truth</hi>) and the <hi>bitter root</hi> lieth deep under the ground; and this it is: (ſaith our Author) <hi>The firſt Chriſtians ſuffered according to the Laws of their Country, whereas theſe under</hi> Julian <hi>were perſecuted contrarie to Law.</hi> Againſt which though I have ſaid enough already to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince impartial men, yet I ſhall now add this further: I wonder how ſuch men can plead the <hi>Laws of the Country</hi> againſt <hi>Perſecution,</hi> who every day <hi>perſecute</hi> thoſe Laws, and live in open defiance and oppoſition of them; contriving and practiſing how to over-throw the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> eſtabliſhed by thoſe Laws. If the <hi>Julian Chriſtians</hi> did (as you ſay) pray for the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>brave</hi> them to their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beards, and threaten to <hi>kick</hi> them; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Law of the Land did maintain ſuch practices: or if they could have found out ſome ſuch Law, yet the Law of God being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated by ſuch practices, God might juſtly puniſh them for the breach of his Laws: for no Law of man, that is temporarie and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, can indemnifie us againſt the Laws of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96115:100"/>God. This is a Maxime with Lawyers (as <hi>Leli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us de privilegiis Eccl.) Nulla lex valèat contra jus Divinum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, p. 68. Julian <hi>found their Religion in quiet poſſeſſion.</hi> What Religion I pray was then in full and quiet poſſeſſion? If any, it was the <hi>Arian,</hi> which your ſelf cannot call Chriſtian, except you add <hi>diſſenting.</hi> And if, as it hath been ſaid, it were as <hi>bad</hi> as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> it was <hi>worſe</hi> than <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> Perhaps this is the Religion of our Author: for no man likely can deride the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but he that denies the <hi>Deity of Chriſt.</hi> But I have ſo far a good opinion of you, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this; and do not therefore give it the Appellative of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of <hi>their Religion, viz.</hi> the <hi>Arians,</hi> or <hi>diſſenting Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this were not the Religion that was in full and quiet poſſeſſion, what was it? to revile, and threaten, and pray for the deſtruction of the Emperour, and to contend earneſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Divinity of Chriſt, as <hi>Conſtantius Julian</hi>'s predeceſſor did? who, as Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> obſerves, <hi>promoted that damnable errour with all his might.</hi> Was this that which you call the reigning Religion? So was that in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> days, when <hi>Iniquity was eſtabliſhed by a Law,</hi> (ſuch as that <hi>lawleſs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.) Can you produce any <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Laws</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:96115:101"/>made by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould obtain throughout <hi>all</hi> his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? <hi>Licinius</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> cruelly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them long after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the Throne. And his Senate conſiſted of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Romans</hi> for a great part. <hi>Euſebius,</hi> chap. 55. of the Life of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſays, <hi>he compelled none to turn Chriſtians;</hi> and chap. 59. <hi>forbid any one to moleſt another for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Our Author might have gone for one of the <hi>Godly partie</hi> in thoſe daies.</p>
                  <p>I do not read that there was <hi>one Law</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout the <hi>whole</hi> Roman Empire, which was almoſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> but that ſeveral Kingdoms and Cities were governed by their own Laws. So were the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi> as well as <hi>Christian</hi> Subjects, in their ſeveral Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and remote Provinces. As <hi>Julian</hi> told the Biſhops that were of ſeveral Perſwaſions, that they ſhould not diſturb the publick peace of the Empire, and then they might enjoy their own Liberties and Religion. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> ſeemed to be almoſt of a like perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for why elſe did he not ſuppreſs the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Hereſie, which from <hi>Alexandria</hi> infected the whole Empire? He did take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> among Chriſtians, that the adminiſtration of the Government might be more eaſie: But this great man baniſhed <hi>Athanaſius</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96115:101"/>till <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his Son recalled him, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Chronologie.</p>
                  <p>But what if there were ſome Edicts for the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s days, nothing was confirmed by the <hi>Senate;</hi> that was accounted then a needleſs thing. Nor did the Edicts of one Emperour bind another: by the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> might have ſetled the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Religion, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſetled the <hi>Arian,</hi> and after him <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion; I mean, by his own Imperial power and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour was an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarch;</hi> their <hi>Will</hi> was a <hi>Law,</hi> as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen,</hi> quoted by you, <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>The Will and Pleaſure of the Emperour is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Law, backed with Power, and much ſtronger than written ones which were not ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Authority.</hi> So that though he did not, as you term it, <hi>fairly enact</hi> Sanguinary Laws, yet had he the Law of the <hi>Sword</hi> in his hands. And I think it was a great mercie of God to the Chriſtians under him, that he did not by publick Edicts put the Sword out of his own hands, into the hands of his Heathen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, who would have <hi>written them all in bloud.</hi> Therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaies, <hi>p.</hi> 20. of 4th part of his <hi>Direct.</hi> Julian <hi>was a protector of the Church from Popular Rage in compariſon of other Perſecutors, though in other reſpects he was a Plague.</hi>

                     <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a right Chriſtian Emperour, and when he was choſen, the Souldiers were importunate that he ſhould aſſume another as an Aſſociate in the Empire: he tells them, <hi>It lay in you to chuſe me your Emperour; but being choſen, what you deſire is not in your power but mine; it belongs to you as Subjects to be quiet, and reſt contented, and to me as your King to conſider what is fit to be done.</hi> Zozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>l.</hi> 6.86.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was another good Emperour, and he aſſumed the ſole adminiſtration of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to himſelf; and demands in his Novels, <hi>Quis tantae authoritatis, ut nolentem Principem poſſit ad convocandos Patres caetoroſque Proceres coarctare?</hi> Who can claim ſo great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to conſtrain the Prince to aſſemble the Senate againſt his will?

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96115:102"/>Panegyrick to <hi>Trajan,</hi> tells him, <hi>how happie he was that he was obliged to nothing.</hi> So that the Chriſtians had no more pretence of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Laws on their ſide</hi> under <hi>Julian,</hi> than under <hi>Diocleſian, Maximus,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> nor did they ever <hi>plead them</hi> to juſtifie a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> againſt him, for want of ſuch an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate or Leader as our Author.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>So that our Author's great <hi>Babel</hi> is fallen, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Julian Chriſtians</hi> had their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed by <hi>Law,</hi> and that they were long poſſeſſed of it: For, Laws or no Laws, by the <hi>Lex Regia</hi> the Emperour could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the old, and eſtabliſh new as it pleaſed him: and for want of Laws, <hi>where the word of the Emperour was, there was power,</hi> and <hi>none might ſay to him, What dost thou?</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and why not with <hi>Julian?</hi> And now I hope the good Chriſtians of <hi>our Age</hi> will no longer truſt to ſuch <hi>broken Reeds</hi> as our Author puts into their hands, much leſs that they ſhould take up the <hi>Sword</hi> (which will be no other than a <hi>broken Reed</hi> alſo, not onely to fail them, but to <hi>pierce through their ſides</hi>).</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:96115:103"/>
                  <p>Now if we ſhould turn the Tables, and ask our Author, Whether when <hi>Jovian</hi> and <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> were Emperours, and had made ſome new Edicts for the <hi>Orthodox Chriſtians,</hi> as well as againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> it had been lawful for the <hi>Arians</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> to rebel in defence of their Religion?

                  </p>
                  <p>Or neerer yet: when the <hi>Long, too Long</hi> Parliament, pretended againſt the King, that their <hi>Religion</hi> was in danger by <hi>Poperie</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> their <hi>Laws and Liberties invaded by an Arbitrary Power;</hi> did they well or ill from theſe pretences to raiſe that War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, that turned the Nation to an <hi>Aceldama?</hi> Were the <hi>Laws</hi> ſuch as could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or no? If they could not, then I am ſure they cannot now, ſince the late Act for <hi>Treaſon,</hi> in the 13th of our King, and a Declaration of Parliament, <hi>That
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96115:103"/>it is not lawful on any pretence whatſoever,</hi> &amp;c And by ſeveral Statutes it is declared, <hi>That the King is the Onely Supreme Governour of his Dominions, over all Perſons and Cauſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> And the power of the <hi>Sword</hi> or <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> is put into his hands, as well by the Law of the Nation, as of God; and I truſt he will not <hi>bear it in vain.</hi>

                  <p>Having thus ſtript this <hi>full-fac'd</hi> Bird of a few borrowed and painted Feathers, how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is he expoſed to be hooted at by every boy, or dealt with as in the Apologue of ſuch another bird, that <hi>ſeeing the Pidgeons to be well meated and live ſecurely, he would get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be coloured and arrayed like one of them, and feed among them, that he might no longer be forced to prey abroad for his livelihood: but having fed with the Pidgeons a while, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that neither head, nor beak, nor claws, were like theirs; and therefore they expel him out of their ſocietie; and then thinking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his old manner of life, the rest fall on him, and baniſh him from them alſo; ſo that he was forced to remain alone as one in the Deſart.</hi> The Moral is onely this: <hi>Though ſome men may for their own concerns, and for a little time, love the Treaſon, yet generally all men hate the Traitor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my part, I cannot ſee any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that did ſo juſtly render <hi>Julian</hi> odious to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96115:104"/>the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> as that he had been (an Apoſtate) <hi>Lecturer</hi> in an Aſſembly of Chriſtians.

That <hi>they throw away their lives, and are certainly wearie of them, who practiſe any ſuch Paſſive Obedience.</hi> And p. 77. That <hi>he is a</hi> felo de ſe, <hi>and guiltie of his own Murder.</hi> And thereupon prepares men for <hi>reſiſtance</hi> of a <hi>lawful Power</hi> (though it be exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully) with an <hi>Ei qui vult viribus uti, erit viriliter reſiſtendum;</hi> applying what was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Bracton</hi> againſt the violent attempts of one <hi>private perſon</hi> againſt another, to the actions of <hi>lawful Princes;</hi> and ſo doth teach the Doctrine of Devils: for, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>Such wiſdom comes not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this might excuſe the ſharpneſs of my Reflections on the <hi>Author,</hi> yet when I ſhall ſhew the provocation I had thereunto, I
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96115:105"/>think every <hi>truly Chriſtian Reader</hi> will juſtifie me. And this it was. When I had read that paſſage in our Author, quoted by him (out of <hi>Zozomen</hi>) p. 60. it came to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that <hi>Milton</hi> (<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Secretarie) in his <hi>Defence of the People of</hi> England for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, made uſe of the ſame quotation, <hi>toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem verbis,</hi> p. 44. From him alſo he took the Theme on which he declaims in ſo many Chapters. For thus <hi>Milton:</hi> Quid Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheni homines apprime Chriſtiani? <hi>What did the</hi> Antiochians, <hi>who were the chiefeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? did they pray for</hi> Julian <hi>the Apoſtate, to whom they came publickly, and rent him</hi> (or, as our Author interprets it, <hi>vext every vein in his Royal heart) with their reproaches, and ſcoffing at his long Beard, bid him make Ropes of it? And when they heard of his death, appointed publick Supplications, Feaſtings, and Mirth, can you think that they ever prayed for his life and ſafetie? What? when it is alſo reported that he was ſlain by a Chriſtian Souldier?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the <hi>Pillars</hi> on which our <hi>Engliſh Solomon</hi> hath raiſed to himſelf that <hi>Temple of Honour;</hi> which yet may prove but as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Pillars of Smoak</hi> to the eyes of all that ſhall inſpect them; and perhaps may have a worſe effect (which <hi>ſmoak</hi> that hath ſo much <hi>fire</hi> under it is wont to have) upon the Author.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96115:105"/>But, let us obſerve what worthie <hi>Lectures</hi> our Author reads us on theſe <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Milton.</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>They reproached him in words.</hi> This Chapter conſiſts of 7 pages. Chap. 4. <hi>Of their Actions.</hi> This hath about 7 more. Chap. 5. and 6. Of their <hi>Prayers</hi> and their <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Devotions,</hi> makes 11 pages. Chap. 7. His Death by a <hi>Chriſtian Souldier;</hi> where you have the paſſage at large out of <hi>Zozomen,</hi> commending ſuch as <hi>kill Tyrants,</hi> 6 pages. Chap. 8. How they uſed his <hi>memorie,</hi> by joy and feaſting at his death, by calling him <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, Traitor,</hi> Killer of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Reflections on their Behaviour.</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>Ad finem.</hi>

                  <p>He quotes alſo the ſame paſſages out of <hi>Bracton</hi> which <hi>Milton</hi> made uſe of, p. 81. <hi>Non eſt Rex, ubi dominatur voluntas, &amp; non Lex: exercere debet Rex poteſtatem Juris, ut Vicarius &amp; Miniſter Dei; poteſtas autem injuriae Diobali eſt, non Dei: cum declinat ad injuriam Rex, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli Miniſter est.</hi> And as if theſe Arguments which that <hi>Mercenarie man</hi> made uſe of to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, were not enough, our Author adds more to them; to what end, he beſt knows. But certainly, if that <hi>Execrable Book</hi> deſerved to be burnt by the <hi>common Hangman</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> this book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be uſed ſo by every <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> it being of much worſe conſequence
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96115:106"/>than that of <hi>Milton: Milton</hi>'s book being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten when the <hi>Father</hi> was in his <hi>Grave,</hi> and this when the <hi>Son</hi> by many miracles of mercie is ſetled and preſerved in the <hi>Throne:</hi> where God long preſerve and proſper him.</p>
                  <p>And this I ſuppoſe is the reaſon that <hi>our Author</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> cannot endure the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 48, no more than that of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baean Legion;</hi> becauſe theſe men are the very <hi>Marſhals</hi> and <hi>Miltons,</hi> the Contrivers and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiers of whatever ſhall be done <hi>according to that pattern in the Mount,</hi> as the old Phraſe was: A Mount like that which is deſcribed <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18. <hi>So full of terrours, as made</hi> Moſes <hi>himſelf to tremble exceedingly.</hi> Perhaps they finding no Preferment in the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> hope to get a Bootie by <hi>fiſhing in troubled waters;</hi> and like the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> (for they were <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> alſo) to <hi>ſit the one at the right, and the other at the left hand</hi> of ſome Great perſon, when he ſhall come into his Kingdom. Or if the hopes of the <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhould fail, and degenerate into a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> one of them may be, as <hi>Milton</hi> was, a <hi>mercenarie Hiſtorian,</hi> or <hi>under-Secretarie of State.</hi> But now I think on it, they will never be ſo fit as <hi>Milton</hi> was, of whom they come as ſhort in <hi>accuracie of Stile,</hi> as they may in time exceed him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Preferments.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is well known, the Romiſh Prieſts
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96115:109"/>are not executed in <hi>England</hi> upon the account of their <hi>Religion,</hi> but for ſuch crimes as are made <hi>Treaſon</hi> by the Laws of our Land.

                  <p>That <hi>Mercenarie wretch</hi> was, I confeſs, a man of more than ordinarie parts: and when he came in his Chap. 4. to defend the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> and <hi>Regicide</hi> againſt that Argument of <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> which proved that none of the Chriſtians before St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s time did practiſe or allow of <hi>reſiſting</hi> the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  <p>And becauſe it hath been creditably reported that <hi>Milton</hi> died a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and it is certain that he had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was there careſſed by ſome great men, (Cardinals and others) I ſhall deſire the Reader to conſider with me, whether that <hi>defence</hi> which he makes of the <hi>Popiſh Doctrine</hi> for <hi>depoſing of Kings,</hi> in the ſame Chapter, be not a probable Argument of the truth of that Report.

                     <hi>a French-man and a Lawyer, denieth that</hi> Chilperick <hi>was depoſed by the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, or that his Kingdom was given to</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin; <hi>but that all this was tranſacted by the authoritie of the great Council of that Nation, as appears by ancient Annals, which ſhew that there was no need of abſolving the Subjects from that Oath; which alſo Pope</hi> Zachary <hi>utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: for in the French Hiſtories it is recorded, as</hi> Hottoman <hi>and</hi> Girardus <hi>witneſs, That the French did from the beginning reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a power as of chuſing, ſo of depoſing their Kings; and that they were not wont to ſwear any other Fidelitie to the Kings whom they created, than that they would yield them Faith and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, if their Kings did perform that which they alſo ſwore to do. So that if the King by male-adminiſtration first broke his Oath, there was no need of the Pope, the perfidiouſneſs of the King having abſolved the ſubjects from their Oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet leſt this Invention of <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>own</hi> ſhould not be of weight to clear his Holineſs, he brings the Popes infallible teſtimonie for <hi>himſelf: Pope</hi> Zachary (ſays he) <hi>who you ſay did arrogate that authoritie to himſelf, excuſeth it, and lays it on the People: for the Popes words are theſe;</hi> If the Prince be obnoxious to the People by whoſe beneficence he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Kingdom, the People that make the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96115:112"/>King may depoſe him. So that the reſult of all is, the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Fanatick</hi> are agreed in this Principle, The <hi>Majeſtas realis</hi> is in the People; as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with <hi>Buchanan</hi> do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; and, <hi>They that create the King, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him with the ſame breath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How induſtrious this <hi>Mercenarie man</hi> is to vindicate the <hi>Pope,</hi> whenas his <hi>own Creatures</hi> acknowledge that he was the <hi>Dux Gregis,</hi> the grand Inſtrument of <hi>dethroning</hi> that <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>ſharing</hi> his Inheritance!</p>
                  <p>In a Dialogue between <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and <hi>Philander</hi> a Jeſuit, Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> (p. 418. of <hi>Chriſtian Subjection</hi>) brings in <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſaying: <hi>Your Law doth not ſtick to boaſt that</hi> Zacharias <hi>depoſed</hi> Childerick <hi>King of</hi> France, <hi>and placed</hi> Pepin <hi>in his room. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> anſwers, <hi>And ſo he did.</hi> Theoph. <hi>Who ſays ſo beſides you?</hi> Philand. Platina <hi>ſaith,</hi> Ejus authoritate regnum Franciae Pipino adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; <hi>By</hi> Zachary<hi>'s authoritie the Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>was adjudged to</hi> Pepin. <hi>And</hi> Friſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis <hi>affirmeth that</hi> Pepin <hi>was abſolved from the Oath of Allegiance</hi> (<hi>by Pope</hi> Steven) <hi>which he had given to</hi> Childerick, <hi>and ſo were the reſt of the Nobles of</hi> France; <hi>and then the King being ſhaven, and thruſt into a Monaſterie,</hi> Pepin <hi>was anointed King: which you think much the Pope ſhould do in our days.</hi> Theoph. Zachary <hi>was conſulted with whether it might lawfully be done
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96115:112"/>or no: he did not openly intermeddle with the matter, whatever his privie practices were; though many of your Biſhops and Monks, to grace the Pope, make it his onely act. —But hear</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary<hi>'s own words, when</hi> Volorade <hi>and</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard <hi>were ſent to underſtand his judgment:</hi> I find <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> in the ſacred ſtorie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scripture, that the people fell away from their wretchleſs and laſcivious King that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Counſel of the Wiſe men of his Realm, and created a ſufficient man of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves King, (<hi>This was likely the caſe of</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, <hi>who had a ſpecial Warrant from God.</hi>) God himſelf allowing their doings. All pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and rule belongs to God; Princes are his Miniſters, and therefore choſen for the people, that they ſhould follow the Will of God, and not do what they liſt.—All that he hath, as Power, Glorie, Riches, Honour, and Dignitie, he receiveth of the People: the People create the King, and may when the cauſe requireth, forſake the King: It is therefore lawful for the <hi>Franks,</hi> refuſing this Monſter <hi>Childerick,</hi> to chuſe one able in War and Peace, by his wiſdom to protect and keep in ſafetie their Wives, Children, Parents, Goods, and Lives. <hi>This is the Popes Divinitie, ſaith Biſhop</hi> Bilſon, <hi>that Kings have their power of the</hi> People, <hi>which the Scripture ſaith they have from</hi> God.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:96115:113"/>
                  <p>Now as to the Annals of <hi>France,</hi> it is true that the Pope had not intirely graſped the power of depoſing Princes in thoſe days, but made uſe of other Inſtruments; yet this was done, ſay the Annals, <hi>Pontifice prius conſulto,</hi> as <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> and the <hi>Gloſs</hi> in verb. <hi>Depoſuit,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>deponentibus, conſenſit.</hi> The true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was this: <hi>Pepin</hi> was a man on whom the Pope relied to quell the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and defeat the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that he and <hi>Pepin</hi> might divide the Spoils of the Weſt, as it came to paſs: for the Emperour was turned out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let the Reader judge how diligent an Advocate <hi>Milton</hi> is for the Pope; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his own words adviſing it, and the teſtimonie of his own creatures affirming it, and the matter of fact and the event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating it, would yet excuſe him from having a hand in depoſing of that French King. And is this a fit <hi>Guide</hi> for our <hi>Modern Writers?</hi> Is it not poſſible (as our Author ſays) but to <hi>take many things from</hi> Doleman <hi>in the caſe of Succeſſion?</hi> and many more from <hi>Milton,</hi> when you would irritate or <hi>defend</hi> the People of <hi>England</hi> in caſe of <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicide?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Have the <hi>Boutefeus</hi> of this Age nothing to ſet the Nation into a <hi>flame,</hi> but thoſe <hi>Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands</hi> which were rak'd up in the Aſhes of that proſligate Villain <hi>Milton,</hi> who pleaded
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96115:113"/>the Cauſe of the Pope <hi>Gratis,</hi> and for money that of—Good God! what a Spirit of <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> is ſpread over the Land! when, as it was obſerved by Dr. <hi>Heylen</hi> at the beginning of the laſt unnatural War, <hi>No times were more full of Odious Pamphlets, no Pamphlets more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauded, nor more dearly bought, than ſuch as do moſt deeply wound thoſe Powers and Dignities to which the Law hath made us ſubject.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we are like the man in the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.44. out of whom the unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being caſt out, it <hi>walked up and down through drie places, ſeeking reſt and finding none: then ſaid he, I will return to my houſe from whence I came out; and finding it emptie, ſwept, and garniſhed, he taketh with him ſeven other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more wicked than himſelf, and they enter in and dwell there: and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt.</hi> Deus avertat O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men!</p>
                  <p>I beg my Readers pardon that I may ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert a little on theſe <hi>Libellers,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, that to <hi>their Progenitors</hi> we owed the kindling, fomenting, and inflaming thoſe late Wars, that made us a <hi>confuſion</hi> at home, a <hi>ſcorn</hi> and a <hi>reproach</hi> abroad. <hi>Prynne, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> were like ſo many <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> let looſe and encouraged, like the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Preco</hi>'s of <hi>Mars,</hi> to ſcatter <hi>Fire-brands</hi> through the Nation. Nor would the times
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96115:114"/>permit a little water to be ſprinkled for the quenching of them, but fed them with oyl. The <hi>Laws</hi> were <hi>ſilenced</hi> and <hi>out-lawed</hi> then, as they are now, as if indeed we were <hi>inter Arma:</hi> there wanted not <hi>ſcourges</hi> to <hi>puniſh</hi> them, but an <hi>arm</hi> to <hi>inflict</hi> the legal Sanctions.</p>
                  <p>Then it was, firſt, That <hi>Burton</hi> in a ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sermon compared that excellent <hi>Prince</hi> to <hi>Julian,</hi> and his <hi>Chapel</hi> to <hi>Julian</hi>'s <hi>Altar:</hi> And tells the ſame ſtorie of <hi>Maris</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> who called <hi>Julian</hi> Atheiſt and Apoſtate to his face, as <hi>our Author</hi> hath done in print. That Male-content having been admitted to the Kings <hi>Chappel</hi> for a while, and defeated of a Biſhoprick to which he aſpired, turned <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> and defamed the <hi>whole Order</hi> as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</hi> He had ſerved that <hi>excellent Prince</hi> in his Cloſer; and miſſing of the <hi>Preferment</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> for his turbulency, being bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thence, he began to <hi>court the People,</hi> and ſought it in the <hi>Camp;</hi> not being aſhamed to profeſs himſelf <hi>an old out-cast Courtier,</hi> worn our of favour and Friends there; which was the reaſon that he became a <hi>Profeſſed enemy</hi> both to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then it was that he made his <hi>Pulpit</hi> a <hi>Drum,</hi> to beat up for <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>War. Prynne, Baſtwick, Leyton,</hi> and <hi>many others,</hi> took the <hi>Alarm;</hi> and dipping their <hi>Pens</hi> in <hi>Gall,</hi> made way for the <hi>Sword,</hi> that glutted it ſelf with ſo
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96115:114"/>much bloud. He preſumes to dedicate his <hi>Seditious Harangues,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Fire-brands,</hi> to the <hi>Houſes of Parliament;</hi> where finding too much combuſtible matter, he made ſuch a flame, as <hi>warmed</hi> him a little, but made a <hi>general conflagration</hi> through the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                  <p>Had it not been much better that <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> ſuch <hi>Boutefeus</hi> had ſuffered according to their deſerts, than that the <hi>whole Nation</hi> ſhould fall a Sacrifice to thoſe <hi>Idols</hi> of a <hi>Seditious party?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There wanted not then good Laws againſt ſuch diſturbers of the publick peace. The <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Weſtm.</hi> the firſt provided, <hi>That no man ſhould publiſh or tell any falſe News whereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or occaſion of diſcord or ſlander may grow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his People or Nobles.</hi> And a Statute was made the ſecond of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. ch. 5, <hi>for puniſhing counterfeiters of falſe news, and lyes, of Prelates, Earls, Dukes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of things which by them were never ſpoken, to the ſlander of the Prelates,</hi> &amp;c. And the puniſhment was left to the diſcretion of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council.</hi> And old <hi>Bracton</hi> records this ancient uſage: <hi>Si quis Machinatus fuerit, vel aliquid fecerit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If any one ſhall contrive or do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the life of the King, or to make Sedition in his Army, or ſhall give conſent or counſel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, although they effect not the miſchief which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96115:115"/>they deſigned; he ſhall be guilty of Treaſon.</hi> And accordingly one <hi>John Bonnet</hi> a Wool-man was drawn and hanged for ſcattering ſeditious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in <hi>London.</hi> In the 4th year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. as <hi>Stow</hi> relates, Sir <hi>William Stanly,</hi> a perſon of great valour, was condemned and executed as a Traitor, for ſaying (leſs than <hi>our Author</hi> doth) <hi>That if he thought</hi> Perkin Warbeck <hi>to be the undoubted Son of</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> 4th, <hi>he would never bear Arms againſt him.</hi> And in the 9th year of <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Bagnal, Scot, Heath,</hi> and <hi>Kennington,</hi> who had taken Sanctuary in St. <hi>Martins le grand,</hi> were taken out, and three of them executed, for forging <hi>Seditious Bills</hi> to the ſlander of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council.</hi> The like proceedings were made againſt <hi>Barrow, Greenwood, Penry, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal,</hi> and many others, who were condemned, and ſome of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for the like <hi>Seditious Writings</hi> againſt Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and her Government: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which I ſhall preſent to our Authors Her Majeſties Proclamation.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96115:119"/>but a Humane Creature:</hi> Wherein he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf as it were even in the ſame breath, having ſaid immediately before, <hi>It is impoſſible any thing can be of mans appointment which is of Gods ordination,</hi> underſtanding it as he doth, not of the <hi>Species,</hi> but of the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right</hi> and <hi>Authoritie</hi> of Government: For <hi>p.</hi> 36. he demands, <hi>Where is the Charter of Kings from God Almighty to be found? for nothing but the declared Will of God can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us— to give up the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people. If they are lawful, I am ſure it is villanie to betray them.</hi> Here you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the people are encouraged to <hi>reſiſt</hi> their Prince, on pretence of defending their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> or elſe they are declared <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains</hi> and <hi>Traitors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us examine the ground of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: He quotes 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Where</hi> (he ſays) <hi>the Apoſtle ſtiles Kings, as well as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours under them, the Ordinance of man: which cannot have any other ſence, but that men make them, and give them their power; and therefore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>when the Apoſtle calls the power of Government Gods Ordinance, it is becauſe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral God approves of Governments;</hi> as if there were any Governours which were advanced if not <hi>Gratia Dei,</hi> as our ſtile hath it, yet <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto ac Dono Divino;</hi> when <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf, who condemned Chriſt, had his power <hi>given him from above.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:96115:120"/>
            <p>I wondered to read this, in a man that had ſhewed much diligence and reading (as to matters of Law) in his Treatiſe concerning the <hi>Biſhops Right,</hi> thus to faulter and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate, in aſſerting (p. 36.) that <hi>Kings have no Charter from God.</hi> And my wonder is yet increaſed, when I read his <hi>confident concluſion.</hi> That <hi>theſe two places</hi> could not be <hi>reconciled by any other interpretation but his own.</hi> I am much inclined to think that Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> knew a better way of reconciling theſe Scriptures; onely, finding no other offering themſelves willingly to ſerve his Hypotheſis, he thought to preſs this of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to it. Now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne that he drives is againſt the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> p. 42. which (ſays he) <hi>is of a Civil nature, not eſtabliſhed by any Divine Right;</hi> —and <hi>the ſeveral limitations of the Deſcent of the Crown, muſt be made by the People in conferring the Royal Dignitie and Power.</hi> Had Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> talked at this rate in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s days, when he was about to make <hi>himſelf a King,</hi> it had been tolerable; but to talk thus in a Kingdom ſo long continued in a <hi>Legal Succeſſion,</hi> and ſo <hi>well conſtituted,</hi> that nothing but <hi>ſuch new ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions</hi> are like to diſturb it, needeth <hi>Pardon,</hi> though he expects <hi>Praiſe</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>In other things I thought Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and bold man, that ſpake his own Sentiments, as if he were <hi>in Civitate libera;</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:96115:120"/>and I would willingly have excuſed him upon that account here, or as a man labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>common fate</hi> of ſuch as meddle with <hi>matters out of their Spheres:</hi> for ſeldom meet we with ſuch <hi>Blunderers</hi> as <hi>Divines,</hi> when they attempt the work of <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>States-men;</hi> or <hi>Lawyers,</hi> when they invade the Office of the <hi>Divine.</hi> But none of theſe things can be pleaded in Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s excuſe: for no doubt he had conſulted with <hi>ſuch Divines</hi> as wrote in the time of the <hi>Late War,</hi> at leaſt ſuch as <hi>had a hand</hi> in that War, and yet ſurvived.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſſemblies Annotations</hi> were at his hand; and I ſuppoſe he would have conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, or ſuch as they were, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> no great friends to Kingly Government. Hear then what they ſay on the words <hi>Ordinance of man. By Ordinance is meant the framing and ordering of Civil Government; called the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man, not becauſe it is invented by, or hath its original from men; for all power is from God,</hi> Rom. 13.1, 2. <hi>though ſometime he uſeth men as means to derive Power or Government to ſuch or ſuch a perſon or perſons, that ſo they might be the more willing to yield Obedience: but becauſe it is proper to men, or becauſe it is diſcharged by men.</hi> And on the word <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> they note: <hi>There is therefore no other Supreme on Earth above the King in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:96115:121"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Pareus</hi> is another <hi>common Author,</hi> and one whom Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> probably would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about this Opinion above others, he having written ſuch things againſt the power of Kings as deſerved to be committed publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the flames. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And there he teacheth you plainly how to reconcile St. <hi>Peter</hi> with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom you make to contradict each other. <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> (ſays he) <hi>calls Magiſtracie a humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, not cauſally, as it is deviſed by men, and ſet up at their pleaſure; but ſubjectively, as it is adminiſtred by men; and objectively, as exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about the government of humane Societies; or laſtly, in reſpect of the end, as conſtituted of God for the benefit of men.</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Paraphraſe I think is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception, becauſe it perfectly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles the ſence of St. <hi>Peter</hi> with that of St. <hi>Paul:</hi> for by <hi>every Ordinance of man,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands <hi>every Heathen Governour, every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prince.</hi> And his <hi>learned Notes</hi> do evince the truth of his interpretation; which being too long to inſert, I refer the Reader to them, and ſhall onely give you his Reaſon, which is this: <hi>That the Gnoſticks, who had ſo early trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Church, taught, that Chriſtian Servants and Subjects were not bound to obey their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Maſters and Magiſtrates; whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle enjoyns them to obey both,</hi> not onely if they be good and gentle, but alſo if they be froward, if they be unbelievers.</p>
            <p>We may not make our <hi>Libertie</hi> a cloak for <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and pretend to <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> our <hi>Countrie,</hi> when we intend to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave it:</hi> As <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who brought a great Armie into <hi>Greece,</hi> pretending to deliver it, when it was in a condition of Freedom and Proſperitie: And thus the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to free themſelves from <hi>one Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> made way for <hi>Thirtie</hi> to domineer over them.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s demand is, what <hi>Scripture</hi> we have for the <hi>Kings Charter.</hi> I anſwer, That
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96115:122"/>
               <hi>Saul</hi> had a Charter, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. for <hi>God choſe him:</hi> and how far it extended, read there, and <hi>Skiccard de Jure Regum apud Hebraeos.</hi> And after God had rejected <hi>Saul,</hi> who had firſt rebelled againſt God, yet he hath the <hi>Title</hi> and the <hi>Reverence</hi> of <hi>the Lords Anointed</hi> given him by <hi>David</hi> ſtill. And God himſelf calls <hi>Cyrus</hi> his <hi>Anointed</hi> (though a Heathen). And <hi>Daniel</hi> acknowledged of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, The God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, ſtrength, and glorie,</hi> Dan. 2.27. Theſe then had it not from the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf, though an Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, had his <hi>Charter owned</hi> and <hi>ſubmitted to</hi> by <hi>Chriſt himſelf.</hi> And when it is ſaid in the Old Teſtament, <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> Prov. 8.15. and in the New, even of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> that they <hi>are ordained by God,</hi> and that our Obedience is due to them <hi>for the Lords ſake,</hi> and <hi>for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake;</hi> He muſt be an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> or worſe, that can ſee in <hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>Charter</hi> for the <hi>Peoples</hi> rights and power even to <hi>reſist</hi> their <hi>Prince,</hi> and none for the <hi>Prince</hi> to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> his Authoritie over the People.</p>
            <p>It would be irkſome to the Reader to relate what is obvious in <hi>Heathen Writers</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Original of <hi>Kingly power.

To this power in the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſubmit <hi>themſelves,</hi> and command <hi>every Soul</hi> to follow their examples: and all the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians</hi> did ſo, till the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the great ſcandal of Chriſtianitie, invaded the <hi>Thrones,</hi> and uſurped the <hi>power</hi> of their <hi>lawful Emperours.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi> and <hi>Paſchal</hi> were the firſt that ſtirred up <hi>Subjects</hi> againſt their <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are taught</hi> (ſaith <hi>Polycarp</hi>) <hi>to yield O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to all Principalities under God, except in things deſtructive to our Souls. Therefore do as you pleaſe; cast me to wild beaſts or the fire, which is not to be compared to that eternal fire prepared for the ungodly.</hi> In the <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Clemens,</hi> it is declared a hainous ſin to <hi>reſist the Prince:</hi> and the <hi>Councils</hi> for 1200 years taught no other Doctrine. And when thoſe Popes firſt turned Rebels, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo imperiouſly as to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> the Biſhop and Church-men of <hi>Liege</hi> for adhering to the Emperour, and ſtirred up <hi>Robert</hi> Earl

            </p>
            <p>This was the ſence of the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proves it by Scripture, and concludes, <hi>By whoſe command they are born men, by his command they are made Princes.</hi> So <hi>Tertul.</hi> Inde Imperator, unde homo; inde po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas, unde Spiritus. <hi>It is God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Origen</hi>) <hi>who ſetteth up Kings, and removeth them; and in his own time raiſeth up ſuch a one as is uſeful to the State:</hi> Contra Celſum. <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch; I will honour the King, not adoring him, but praying for him; knowing that by God the King is ordained.</hi> So <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> of <hi>Aurelius</hi> and his Son <hi>Commodus,</hi> ſays, <hi>They had received the Kingdom from above.</hi> St. <hi>Baſil</hi> alſo on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>The Lord ſetteth up Kings, and removeth them; and there is no power but what is ordained of God.</hi> And to conclude with <hi>Greg.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96115:123"/>Governor of his Province, <hi>Orat.</hi> 17. to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Antioch, That together with Christ he did rule the people committed to his charge; that from him he had received the Sword, and was to be accounted as the Image of God.</hi> So S. <hi>Chryſoſtom: And if we reverence thoſe Officers that are choſen by the King, though they be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, though they be Thieves and Robbers, not deſpiſing them for their wickedneſs, but ſtanding in awe of them for the dignitie of him that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them; much more ought we thus to do in the caſe of God, and the King choſen by him.</hi> Serm. 1. of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>even wicked Princes</hi> have a <hi>Charter</hi> from God. So, our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Pilate,</hi> Joh. 19.11. <hi>Thou couldest have no</hi>

            <p>And as God ſetteth them in the Throne, ſo he rules by them, and over-rules them, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their actions to his own juſt and wiſe ends.

               <p>It is a pernicious Opinion, that hath infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted too many of this Age, <hi>That though we do not actively obey the Princes Commands, yet if we ſubmit to the Penalty, the Law is ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we are free from guilt.</hi> In anſwer to which, I ſay:</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Suffering, or paying the penaltie,</hi> is not the chief intention of the Law; but the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Obedience,</hi> without which the <hi>ends of Government</hi> will be fruſtrated, <hi>viz. Peace</hi> and <hi>good Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law of God enjoyns us to obey the Laws of men that are not contrary to his Law. Now though we ſatisfie the Law of our Country by <hi>bearing the penalty,</hi> yet the Law of God is not thereby ſatisfied; that Law requires <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Amendment, (i. e.)</hi> that we do ſo no more. As in that inſtance of <hi>frequenting Divine Service,</hi> we do not think a <hi>Papist</hi> hath <hi>ſatisfied the Law</hi> when he pays Twelve pence; neither indeed do others: For it is Gods Law that is broken, who commands us <hi>not to forſake the publick Aſſemblies;</hi> and to <hi>obey them that have the rule over us:</hi> For we are to obey <hi>for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96115:129"/>ſake,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe of the <hi>obligation</hi> which the Command of God hath laid upon us). And when the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> calls for our <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in this or that particular which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Word, God commands our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, he having Gods Authority in ſuch caſes; and to diſobey, is not onely to diſobey man, but God: <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> and for <hi>Conſcience ſake:</hi> and the penalty of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is <hi>damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that it is an <hi>Atheiſtical Suggeſtion,</hi> that <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Tyrants</hi> did firſt <hi>invent Religion,</hi> to keep men in awe. For although no other Terrours are ſufficient to keep men in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience but thoſe of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe men may carry on their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous deſigns ſo <hi>ſecretly,</hi> or with ſuch a <hi>high hand,</hi> as to eſcape puniſhment in this life; yet it is not <hi>man</hi> but <hi>God</hi> that requireth obedience even to humane Laws, under the <hi>Severeſt San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of <hi>Eternal Death..</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But what if the thing commanded be not <hi>good?</hi> then we owe <hi>no Obedience:</hi> for the Magiſtrate is no longer <hi>Gods Miniſter</hi> than he commands <hi>for God:</hi> When he commands <hi>against God,</hi> he commands <hi>without Authority,</hi> and ſo we may <hi>diſobey him</hi> without ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are but two <hi>Rules</hi> whereby we are to judge whether the Commands
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96115:129"/>of our Superiours are <hi>good</hi> or <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is the Law of <hi>God;</hi> and when we make <hi>that</hi> our Rule, we muſt be as <hi>ſure</hi> that the Word of God <hi>condemns</hi> what the Magiſtrates <hi>command,</hi> as we are ſure that God commands us <hi>to obey</hi> our Magiſtrate: And in all reaſon we ſhould chuſe what is our moſt <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſable duty,</hi> before that which is <hi>doubtful;</hi> eſpecially when the penalty of <hi>not obeying</hi> is no leſs than <hi>Damnation:</hi> for that is the <hi>wages of ſin,</hi> or diſobedience to Gods Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Rule is the Laws of <hi>men,</hi> which do <hi>bind the Conſcience</hi> when the Command is not contrary to Gods Word. So that the <hi>Caſe</hi> to be <hi>reſolved</hi> is onely this: What we muſt do when the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> commands things which <hi>we judge</hi> not expedient. In which caſe, conſidering eſpecially <hi>our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> the <hi>Laws eſtabliſhed</hi> being ſuch as we <hi>our ſelves</hi> have <hi>conſented to,</hi> it is too late for us to diſpute the <hi>inexpediency</hi> of them; for ſo there can never be an <hi>eſtabliſhment,</hi> it being impoſſible to make ſuch Laws as may not be excepted againſt by <hi>ſome,</hi> eſpecially <hi>ſuch as tranſgreſs the Laws.</hi> In ſuch caſes therefore, the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> not the <hi>Subject,</hi> is to <hi>expound</hi> the Law.</p>
               <p>It is ſufficient that the Laws have a <hi>tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> to the <hi>publick</hi> and more <hi>general good,</hi> though
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96115:130"/>ſome private men may ſuffer in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: And when <hi>reſiſting</hi> thoſe Laws which are made, will do more <hi>hurt</hi> than <hi>good,</hi> we ought to <hi>obey them,</hi> though we <hi>ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly</hi> in ſo doing. As Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> gives an inſtance in <hi>Souldiers</hi> who for their <hi>Cowardiſe,</hi> or ſome <hi>other crime,</hi> are adjudged to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in a way of <hi>Decimation,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> every tenth man): now although ſome of thoſe that ſuffer may be <hi>guiltleſs</hi> and <hi>valiant</hi> men, yet the <hi>private inconvenience</hi> muſt be <hi>endured,</hi> rather than a <hi>publick miſchief</hi> ſhould be <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</hi> Of this the <hi>Learned Caſuist</hi> ſpeaks ſo largely and ſatisfactorily, that I ſhall refer my <hi>Reader</hi> to his laſt Praelection, <hi>p.</hi> 356. <hi>De Obligatione Conſcientiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we are commanded to do what we apprehend not to be for our good, we muſt have a double conſideration: Firſt, to the <hi>perſon commanding,</hi> who is <hi>Gods Miniſter,</hi> and therefore may not be <hi>reſiſted,</hi> though, in the ſecond place, he <hi>abuſe his power</hi> in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what is <hi>not good</hi> or <hi>lawful:</hi> For if in this caſe we <hi>reſist,</hi> we <hi>uſurp</hi> the Power, and <hi>invade</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> that God hath ſet over us. If we might <hi>reſist</hi> when <hi>we apprehend</hi> that we are commanded things againſt our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Liberties,</hi> then there could be no ſuch thing as <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;</hi> and then there would not long be any

The beſt and ſafeſt courſe, in ſuch a caſe, is either to preſerve our ſelves by flight, or reſolutely to undergo whatever ſhall be impoſed on us. His Reaſon is cogent: Becauſe Civil Societies being inſtituted for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace, there accrues to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth a greater Right over us and ours, ſo far as is neceſſarie for that end.—And if a promiſcuous Right of forcible Reſiſtance ſhould be tolerated, it would be no longer a Commonwealth, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a Sanctuarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Oppreſſion, but a confuſed Rabble.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For this, among other things, he quotes that noted Saying, <q>
                     <hi>Principi Summum rerum
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96115:135"/>arbitrium dii dederunt, ſubditis obſequii glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria relicta eſt.</hi> God hath given to Princes the Soveraign power, leaving to us the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Obedience. If a Souldier reſiſt his Captain, ſtriking him, and but lays hold of his Weapon, he is caſheered; if he break it, or ſtrike again, he ſhall be put to death.</q> That this was the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law, he proves from <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.18. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14. which he ſo expounds,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That the Governours may not be reſiſted, though they command what is not right. And therefore it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that place of <hi>Samuel,</hi> v. 18. that when the people are ſo oppreſſed by their King, that there is no remedie, they are to invoke his help who is the Supreme Judge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. And when our Saviour commands in the New Teſtament to give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due, he intended doubtleſs that they ſhould yield as great, if not greater O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, both Active and Paſſive, unto the Higher Power, than what was due from the <hi>Jews;</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) expounds more largely, and chargeth thoſe that <hi>reſiſt the power</hi> of Kings with no leſs Crime than <hi>rebellion againſt Gods Ordinance,</hi> and with a Judgment as great as their ſin. So that as there is a neceſſitie for our <hi>Subjection,</hi> there is alſo for our <hi>Not Reſiſting:</hi> Wherefore the Powers ſet over us are to be obeyed, not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilely,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96115:135"/>ſuperſtitiouſly, or out of fear; but with free, rational, and generous Spirits, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam à diis dati,</hi> as being Gods Ordinance; and being <hi>commiſſioned</hi> by him, cannot do more or leſs than he <hi>orders</hi> and <hi>permits</hi> them to do.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is drawn from our benefit, the Government being conſtituted <hi>for our good,</hi> and therefore in conſcience <hi>not to be reſiſted:</hi> for the Apoſtles Argument reſpects that <hi>univerſal good</hi> for which <hi>Government,</hi> was firſt inſtituted, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the <hi>publick Peace,</hi> wherein every one is concerned more than in his private.—Now he that <hi>reſiſts,</hi> doth as much as in him lies <hi>diſſolve</hi> his Countries <hi>Peace,</hi> and ſo will <hi>burie</hi> himſelf in the <hi>Ruines</hi> of it at the end; and were it not for <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernmens,</hi> a <hi>Kingdom</hi> would be but like a great <hi>Pond,</hi> wherein the <hi>bigger</hi> Fiſhes devour the <hi>leſſer.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the Supreme Magiſtrate doth ſometime, through fear, anger, luſt, or other paſſions, <hi>ſwerve</hi> from the path of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Equitie;</hi> yet theſe hapning but <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> are to be paſt by as <hi>perſonal blemiſhes:</hi> which, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves, are abundantly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96115:136"/>recompenſed by the benefit of <hi>better Princes.</hi> —Laws may be called <hi>good,</hi> though they fit not <hi>every mans</hi> caſe, if they obviate ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders as are frequently practiſed, and ſo do good to the <hi>generalitie</hi> of the People.

               <p>But if <hi>any</hi> cauſe can juſtifie <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> it muſt be that of <hi>Religion;</hi> and, if <hi>any Religion,</hi> that which is the <hi>true Religion.</hi> Now if we admit the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to be the <hi>trueſt Religion,</hi> that condemns <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> above any
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96115:136"/>other, as hath been demonſtrated by its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and the <hi>practice</hi> of thoſe <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> who beſt knew the ſence and the mind of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in thoſe Precepts: and if any Chriſtians ſhould maintain the contrarie, it would give the <hi>Princes of the World</hi> a juſt occaſion to be <hi>jealous</hi> of it, and <hi>root it out</hi> of their <hi>Dominions:</hi> for what Prince would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any <hi>ſuch number</hi> of men to <hi>abide</hi> and <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply</hi> in their <hi>Dominions,</hi> that profeſs it to be <hi>lawful</hi> to make <hi>reſiſtance</hi> againſt them?</p>
               <p>Beſides, there are few men bred up in <hi>any Religion,</hi> but they think their <hi>own</hi> to be the <hi>true Religion:</hi> and then they may <hi>reſiſt</hi> their <hi>Prince,</hi> how falſe and deſtructive ſoever it be; and ſo a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> may think it <hi>lawful</hi> for them to <hi>reſiſt;</hi> and ſo <hi>no Prince</hi> can be ſecure of the <hi>Obedience</hi> of his People.

                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:96115:137"/>Where I perceive, as great a Lawyer as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> is, he hath taken honeſt <hi>John Milton</hi> into his Conſult; who ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44. of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> (Idem bellum <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantio</hi> indixerunt, &amp; quantum in ſe erat, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio &amp; vita ſpoliarunt) <hi>That they waged War with</hi> Conſtantius, <hi>and as much as in them lay, ſpoiled him of his Life and Empire.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid by <hi>Milton,</hi> how <hi>notoriouſly falſe</hi> ſoever, Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> is ready to aſſert the truth of it, and makes an offer of as <hi>good Authoritie</hi> for it, as ever <hi>Milton</hi> did for the <hi>Kings Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> as will appear by the Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>This paſſage refers us to a <hi>horrible Relation</hi> of the <hi>Arian Perſecution</hi> acted by <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who procured <hi>Edicts</hi> from that <hi>Emperour</hi> to force the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the <hi>Arian</hi> infidelity. The Hiſtory begins <hi>chap.</hi> 27. <hi>Macedonius</hi> after the death of <hi>Paul</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (who was baniſhed firſt, and then ſlain in exile by the <hi>Arians, Athanaſius</hi> hardly eſcaping them) enters on thoſe Churches, who having great power with the Emperour, ſtirred up as great Wars and Cruelties between the Chriſtians themſelves, as any that were acted by the Tyrants; and he got his impious actings to be confirmed by the Emperours Edicts. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he proclaims the Edicts in all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Souldiers are enjoyned to aſſiſt him: The Orthodox are baniſhed not onely
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96115:138"/>from their Churches, but their Cities — Then they conſtrain the people againſt their wills to communicate with the <hi>Arians,</hi> and uſed as great violence as ever any of thoſe uſed that forced the Chriſtians to the worſhipping of Idols, applying Whips, Tortures, and all kind of Cruelties. Some were Sequeſtred of all their Goods; others Baniſhed; many died under their Torments; and thoſe that were to be Baniſhed, were ſlain in the way. Theſe Cruelties were practiſed throughout all the Cities of the Eaſt-part of the Empire, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Perſecution when <hi>Macedonius</hi> was made Biſhop, was increaſed more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; of which <hi>Socrates,</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 38, gives a fuller relation, <hi>p.</hi> 142, <hi>Edit. Valeſii:</hi> That he then perſecuted not onely <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but the <hi>Novatians</hi> alſo, who agreed with the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> in the <hi>Conſubſtantiality.</hi> Both were oppreſſed with intolerable miſchiefs. <hi>Agel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the Biſhop of the <hi>Novatians</hi> is forced to flee; but many, eminent for their piety, were apprehended and tormented for refuſing to communicate with them; and after other Tortures, they gagg'd their Moueths with Wood, and forced their Sacrament into them: which was to thoſe good men the greateſt torment of all. They alſo forced the Women and Children to receive their Baptiſm. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96115:138"/>reſiſted, they uſed Whips, Bonds, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and other cruelties; of which it ſhall ſuffice to relate one or two inſtances, leaving the Auditors to judge by them, of the inhumane actings of <hi>Macedonius</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Such Women as would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them, they firſt ſqueezed their Breaſts in a Box, and then cut them off; ſome with Iron, and others with Cauſticks of ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Eggs. A new kind of torment, never uſed by the <hi>Heathen</hi> againſt us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> was invented by theſe who profeſſed Chriſtianity. Theſe things I am informed of, ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> by <hi>Auxanontes</hi> a very old man, a Presbyter of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Church; who before he was made Presbyter, endured many indignities, being caſt into Priſon with one <hi>Alexander</hi> a <hi>Paphlagonian,</hi> and beaten with many ſtripes, whereof this <hi>Alexander</hi> died in priſon, but <hi>Auxanontes</hi> lived to endure more torments.</p>
               <p>I have not time to tranſlate the entire Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, which may be read in that Chapter; I ſhall therefore come to that part of it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by Mr. <hi>Hunt:</hi> which is thus:</p>
               <p>Macedonius, <hi>hearing that in the Province of</hi> Paphlagonia, <hi>eſpecially at</hi> Mantinium, <hi>there were ſuch a multitude of</hi> Novatians <hi>as could not be expelled by the</hi> Arian <hi>Eccleſiaſticks, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures four Companies of Souldiers to force them to turn</hi> Arians. <hi>They, in defence of their Sect,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96115:139"/>armed themſelves with deſpair, as with Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; and gathering together in a Body, with Hooks, and Hatchets, and what Weapons were at hand, met the Souldiers; in which ſcuffle many of the</hi> Paphlagonians, <hi>and neer all the</hi> Souldiers, <hi>were ſlain. This I heard</hi> (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>) <hi>from a</hi> Paphlagonian <hi>that was in the Fight:</hi> And he adds, that <hi>the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was offended with</hi> Macedonius <hi>for this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould indeed have wondered at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> in accuſing from this ſtory the <hi>Orthodox</hi> for <hi>arming</hi> themſelves in defence of their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> when it was onely a rout of <hi>Novatians</hi> that were by the <hi>Arian</hi> crueltie driven to deſpair, that defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt them. But I am ſo <hi>tranſported</hi> at <hi>another ſaying</hi> of his, that I have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of any thing elſe, how <hi>falſe</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ſoever: You ſhall find it, <hi>p.</hi> 192. of his Treatiſe concerning the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> where having ſuggeſted, that if the D. be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, he doth certainly <hi>make us miſerable;</hi> and mincing the matter a little, ſaying, <hi>We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude onely his Perſon, not his Poſteritie:</hi> he is not afraid to add — <hi>And we will not entail a War upon the Nation, though for the Sake and Interest of the glorious Familie of the ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARTS.</hi> The ſpeech is ſo <hi>heinous,</hi> that it cannot admit any <hi>aggravation.</hi> Well may
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96115:139"/>ſuch men as <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Plagiary</hi> ſeek to juſtifie <hi>reſiſtance</hi> of <hi>lawful Powers,</hi> having in effect not onely <hi>drawn the Sword,</hi> but <hi>caſt away the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.</hi> We are told of one that was ready to <hi>kick</hi> an <hi>Emperour,</hi> and of others that <hi>play'd with his Beard;</hi> but this is little leſs than <hi>kicking</hi> at the <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>ſtriking a blow</hi> at the <hi>root,</hi> to render the <hi>whole Family</hi> as glorious as they <hi>made the Father of it:</hi> Unleſs he can give ſome <hi>other ſence</hi> of it than this: <hi>Rather than not exclude the D. we will exclude the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Family of the</hi> Stuarts. And in what ſence he calls it <hi>a glorious Family,</hi> needs his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>But will the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of the D. as certainly prevent our <hi>miſery,</hi> as his <hi>Succeſſion effect</hi> it? Did you never read how zealous ſome Prieſts and Phariſees were for a <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> againſt a <hi>far better</hi> perſon? John 11.47, 48. <hi>What do we? for this man doth many Miracles: if we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, &amp; the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans will come, &amp; take away both our place &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> And did not the <hi>paſſing</hi> that <hi>Bill,</hi> make way for the <hi>Romans</hi> to bring <hi>all their fears</hi> on their own heads? And was not our late <hi>dear King</hi> excluded from <hi>Crown, Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> upon ſuch <hi>fears;</hi> and was that a means of our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happineſs?</hi> I wiſh I could ſay our <hi>fears now,</hi> are as falſe as they were <hi>then.</hi> We have his R. H. <hi>Declaration</hi> for our <hi>Security,</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:96115:140"/>viz. <hi>That the Members of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are the beſt ſupporters of the Crown.</hi> Inſomuch that if it fall to him to be <hi>concerned,</hi> he will ever <hi>countenance</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> them and it. And p. 225. Why may we not ſuppoſe that a Popiſh Succeſſor will defend his <hi>Regalia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope? Our Ancient Kings did ſo in the Reign of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.16. c. 5. In a Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> the Parliament declares. <hi>That the Crown of</hi> England, (againſt the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Pope, <hi>hath been ſo free at all times, that ſo hath been in no earthly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but immediately ſubject to God in all things touching the Regalty of the ſame Crown, and to none other. And God defend</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that it ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Pope, and the Laws and Statutes of the Realm be by him defeated and avoided at his will, in perpetual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Soveraignty of the King our Lord, his Crown, Regalty and of all his Realm.</hi> And I hope his Royal Highneſs will ſay as they did, <hi>God defend.</hi> Moreover, the Commons ſay, That <hi>the things ſo attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (viz. <hi>purchaſing Bulls from</hi> Rome, <hi>executing Judgments given in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Prelates out of the Realm,</hi> or from one <hi>Preferment</hi> to another) <hi>be clearly againſt the Kings Crown and Regalty uſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the time of all his Progenitors: Wherefore they and all the ſiege Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the ſame Realm will ſtand with
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96115:140"/>our ſaid Lord the King, and his Crown and Regalty in the Caſes aforeſaid, and in all other caſes attempted againſt him and his Crown and Regalty in all points, to live and to dye. And moreover they pray the king, and him require by way of Juſtice, that he would examine all the Lords in the Parliament, as well Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as Temporal, ſeverally, and all the Eſtates of the Parliament, how they think of the Caſes aforeſaid, which be ſo openly againſt the Kings Crown, and in derogation of his Regalty, how they will ſtand in the ſame caſes with our Lord the King in upholding the rights of the ſaid Crown and Regalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like promiſes were made by the <hi>Lords Temporal and Spiritual,</hi> and the default was to be puniſhed by a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> which is, To be put out of the King protection, and their Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels forfeited to the King; and that they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached by their bodie, if they may be found, and brought before the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, there to anſwer to the Caſes aforeſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if theſe <hi>profeſſed Papiſts</hi> did ſo reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unanimouſly conteſt the <hi>Regalia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> what greater zeal and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may we juſtly expect from a <hi>Proteſtant Parliament</hi> (for ſuch we may have, if it be not our own fault) if the <hi>Pope</hi> or any <hi>Agents of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96115:141"/>his</hi> ſhould attempt to deſtroy the foundations of our <hi>eſtabliſhed Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> we read how much <hi>time,</hi> and what <hi>contrivances</hi> and <hi>largeſſes</hi> it coſt <hi>that Queen</hi> to form a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to lier <hi>liking,</hi> though then the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were <hi>moſtly Papiſts;</hi> and how much they contended ſtill for the <hi>Regalia</hi> againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and reſerving of <hi>Abby-lands,</hi> &amp;c. to the Purchaſers: nor, when all was done, did any man ſuffer without <hi>publick proceſs</hi> in form of <hi>Law:</hi> there were no <hi>throats cut,</hi> nor bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>private Meſſengers</hi> or <hi>Aſſaſſinates,</hi> as we are taught to expect from <hi>every Juſtice of Peace and Tything man,</hi> p. 85. and by I know not what <hi>Janizaries;</hi> and that we ſhall be ſlain <hi>to ſee what Grimaces we make,</hi> p. 89. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the number that ſuffered in her <hi>five years,</hi> were not comparable to the number that have been ſlain in <hi>one hours fight</hi> during the <hi>Rebellion;</hi> nor indeed to thoſe that were <hi>Martyred</hi> for their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> by <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal proceedings</hi> in the <hi>Mock-Courts of Juſtice,</hi> during that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation:</hi> the number of the <hi>Marian Martyrs</hi> being not above three or four hundred (though they were too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.).</p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Wiſe man</hi> ſhould look <hi>back</hi> upon the miſchiefs that <hi>have</hi> befallen the Nation by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting</hi> the <hi>lawful Prince,</hi> and the endeavours to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96115:141"/>
                  <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> from the <hi>right Heir;</hi> as well as <hi>forward</hi> upon the miſchiefs that <hi>may never</hi> be, and which upon a ſuppoſition of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour</hi> are aggravated almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a poſſibilitie of being effected. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what it coſt the Nation when the <hi>Succeſſion to the Crown</hi> was <hi>diſputed</hi> between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter:</hi> There periſhed in that War, as Hiſtorians do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, two Kings, one Prince, ten Dukes, two Marqueſſes, twentie one Earls, twentie ſeven Lords, two Viſcounts, one Lord Prior, one Judge, one hundred thirtie nine Knights, four hundred twentie one Eſquires; and of the Gentrie and Commons an incredible number. So that in ſuch caſes, the <hi>Remedie</hi> is generally worſe than the <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have not ſaid this (God is my witneſs) to abate the <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> care of the Nation to keep out Poperie, by ſuch timely proviſion as his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> and his <hi>great Council</hi> ſhall ſee moſt probable; but to allay the <hi>inordinate Hearts</hi> which may ſet the whole Kingdom in a <hi>ſudden flame,</hi> onely to prevent the <hi>fear</hi> of the ſuffering <hi>a Trial of our Faith,</hi> if God ſhould call us to it. And I cannot conſider, without ſome horror, what ſore and long <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Devaſtations</hi> may follow upon a <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> as well as on a <hi>Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> And if of <hi>two evils</hi> the <hi>leaſt</hi> is to be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96115:142"/>choſen, I ſhould rather (if the Will of God ſo be) ſubmit to my lot, how hard ſoever, under ſuch a One, than that the <hi>whole Nation</hi> ſhould be <hi>rent in pieces</hi> again, either by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> at home, or <hi>Invaſions</hi> from abroad; which may happen upon ſuch an <hi>Excluſion:</hi> for, <hi>Regum afflictae fortunae facile multorum O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem alliciant ad miſericordiam, maximeque eorum qui aut Reges ſunt, aut vivunt in Regno quod Regale iis nomen magnum &amp; ſanctum eſſe videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> The oppreſſed eſtate of Kings eaſily moves many to pitie, eſpecially them who are either Kings themſelves, or do live in a Kingdom to whom the name of a <hi>King</hi> is <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> and <hi>Sacred;</hi> Saith the great Orator, <hi>Pro lege Manil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore leave the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Great Council</hi> to their <hi>free Determinations,</hi> and acquieſce in the ſage advice of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Maſter, Acts 5.39. <hi>Let us refrain from theſe things: for if this counſel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, leſt haply ye be found even to fight againſt God.</hi> And I ſhall conclude the buſineſs of <hi>Excluſion</hi> with the Determination of Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſingle Judgment</hi> will outweigh in an equal ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance <hi>all the Opinions</hi> of the Oppoſers: You have it, <hi>p.</hi> 350. of his book <hi>de Obligatione Conſcientiae. I think</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96115:142"/>Kingdom may not lawfully be changed for an Elective</hi> (as in and by the <hi>Excluſion</hi> it is like to be), <hi>nor for any other form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either by the People alone, nor by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nobles joyntly, nor by the whole bodie of the People in their greateſt latitude, that is, the People, Nobles, and the King, conſenting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: unleſs perhaps the Royal Progenie ſhould ſo totally fail, that there is not one ſurviving, who may claim it as his due by Right of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> And let it be conſidered, that he wrote this before the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> was ever dreamt of.</p>
               <p>And now I cannot but reflect upon the <hi>Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticators</hi> and <hi>Wizards</hi> of our Time, that amuſe the people with the <hi>fancies</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> which their <hi>own guilt</hi> hath created, as if we ſhould be all ſwallowed up in a moment, and there were a <hi>fatal neceſſitie</hi> of <hi>endleſs miſeries</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us: ſuch as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and <hi>our Author,</hi> who, <hi>p.</hi> 89. tells us of <hi>ſuch a diſmal proſpect as makes every honeſt mans heart to ſhake.</hi> I remember, ſome years ſince, upon the <hi>great Eclipſe</hi> of the <hi>Sun, Lilly</hi> and ſome others made ſuch a diſmal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as ſtruck a <hi>terror</hi> into a great part of the Countrie, and made them take home their Cattel to their houſes, and ſeek Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary themſelves in the Churches, as if Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day were come; when the cauſe was <hi>natural,</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:96115:143"/>and nothing fell out but according to <hi>that courſe</hi> which God had appointed for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavenly bodies. Though <hi>wiſe men</hi> are not moved at ſuch <hi>bugbears,</hi> yet they have an ill Aſpect on the <hi>people,</hi> to diſpoſe them for ſuch <hi>Commotions</hi> as may promote the intereſt of <hi>diſcontented</hi> and <hi>deſigning</hi> men.</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſhall <hi>continue</hi> to pray for his Royal Highneſs, as our Liturgy directs; and if it be the will of God to ſend us a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> to puniſh us for our <hi>reſiſtance</hi> of a <hi>Proteſtant King,</hi> whoſe bloud ſtill cries for Vengeance; I had rather die for not reſiſting him, than to be as <hi>inſtrumental</hi> in procuring a <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> as <hi>this man</hi> would be, and as <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> as he can hope to be, &amp; at my death to have it written on my Tomb, <hi>Here lieth the firſt Author of this Sentence: RATHER THAN THE D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KE OF</hi> Y. <hi>SHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LD NOT BE EXCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DED, WE WILL EXCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DE THE GLORIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S FAMILY OF THE ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ARTS.</hi> And I will yet pray againſt the wickedneſs of <hi>theſe men: Lord cloath all ſuch his enemies with ſhame; but upon his head, and the heads of his ſeed, let the Crown flouriſh,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I perceive Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> to be a great <hi>devoto</hi> to <hi>ſome kind</hi> of <hi>Parliaments;</hi> and that which was convened in the firſt of King <hi>James,</hi> was
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96115:143"/>one that conſiſted of Wiſe, Loyal, and Pious perſons; I intreat him therefore to conſider what was <hi>Enacted</hi> by them in their <hi>Recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Jacobi;</hi> where after the <hi>Preamble</hi> it is thus declared: <hi>We therefore your moſt humble and Loyal Subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in this preſent Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, do from the bottom of our hearts yield to the Divine Majeſty all humble thanks and praiſes, not onely for the ſaid unſpeakeable and ineſtimable benefits and bleſſings above-mentioned, but alſo that he hath further enriched your Highneſs with a moſt Royal Progeny of moſt rare and excellent gifts and forwardneſs, and in his goodneſs is like to encreaſe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py number of them.

               <p>I have but one Remark more on Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> which is, that he hath conſulted another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author, one Mr. <hi>Thomas White,</hi> who, being a <hi>Romiſh Emiſſary,</hi> made it his buſineſs to continue our <hi>diſtractions.</hi> This man wrote a Book entituled, <hi>The Grounds of Obedience and Government:</hi> And his Motto is, <hi>Salus Populi Suprema Lex eſto;</hi> whereof I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you the genuine ſence already.</p>
               <p>Now among many other Notes tranſcribed by Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> from this <hi>Jeſuitical Writer,</hi> p. 158. he comes to anſwer the Objections of <hi>Divines</hi> concerning <hi>the Authoritie of Princes,</hi> and <hi>non-reſiſtance. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p ſteps the Divine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to preach us out of Scripture the Dutie we owe to Kings, no leſs than Death and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being the guerdons of Diſobedience and Rebellion.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 159. <hi>They will ſpeak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too, telling us, that God by nature is high Lord and Maſter of all: That whoever is in power receiveth his right from him: That Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience conſiſts in doing the Will of him that commandeth; and conclude, that his Will ought to be obeyed till God taketh away the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>till he who is to be obeyed himſelf releaſeth the Right.</hi> Beſides, <hi>p.</hi> 160. <hi>They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that God by his ſpecial command transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Kingdom from</hi> Saul <hi>to</hi> David, <hi>from</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam <hi>to</hi> Jeroboam. <hi>So that in fine, all that is brought out of Scripture falleth ſhort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96115:145"/>that no time can make void the right of a King once given him by the hand of God.</hi> Now mark what Mr. <hi>White</hi> ſays to overthrow the ſenſe of theſe Scriptures. <hi>The reaſon</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of THIS WEAK WAY OF AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEADGING SCRIPT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE is, that when they read that God commandeth or doth this, they look not into Nature to know what this Commanding or Doing is, but preſently imagine God commands it by expreſs and direct words, and doth it by an immediate poſition of the things ſaid to be done; whereas in Nature the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are nothing but the natural Light God hath beſtowed on Mankind, and which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore frequently called the Law of Nature. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Gods doing a thing is many times onely the courſe of natural ſecond Cauſes; to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God gives the Direction and Motion, he both doth, and is ſaid to do all that is done by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to the <hi>ſame end</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> to prove that Kingly Government is not from <hi>God</hi> but the <hi>People,</hi> and therefore may be <hi>altered</hi> and <hi>reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi>) and in the <hi>ſame words</hi> for the moſt part, doth Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> deliver this black invention of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> p. 144. <hi>The nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and its Original hath been prejudiced</hi>—<hi>by men that underſtand nothing but words: and Grammar-divines, that without contemplating Gods Attributes, or the Nature of man, or the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96115:146"/>reaſonableneſs of moral Precepts, have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to declare the ſence of Scripture; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that Soveraign Power is not of Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but of Divine Appointment, becauſe they find it there written,</hi> That by him Kings reign: <hi>Imagining, that when the Scripture ſaith God commands or doth this, that God commanded it by expreſs words, or doth it by an immediate poſition of the thing done; whereas in nature his Commands are nothing but the natural Light God hath beſtowed on Mankind: Likewiſe Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing is onely the courſe of natural and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, to which becauſe God gives Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Motion, he doth both, and is ſaid to do all that is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewiſe Gods doing a thing, is onely the courſe of natural and ſecond Cauſes, to which; becauſe God gives the Direction or Motion, he doth both, and is ſaid to do all that is done.</hi> All this is <hi>verbatim</hi> Mr. <hi>White:</hi> So is his Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie in the <hi>ſame Phraſe,</hi> to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> on Divines that would prove <hi>Government</hi> out of the <hi>Scripture: White</hi> calls them <hi>Grammar-Divines, Verbal and wind-blown Divines,</hi> p. 162. And Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> calls them <hi>Men that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing but Words, and Grammar-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.

               <p>IT is a very <hi>hard Caſe,</hi> that when the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> injoyns ſuch as are of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in this Nation to <hi>put the people in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and powers;</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to which we have ſubſcribed, oblige us <hi>four times in the year at leaſt,</hi> to manifeſt, open, and declare, in our <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> and <hi>Lectures, That the Kings power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Majeſties Realms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is the higheſt power under God, to whom all men born within the ſame, do by Gods Laws owe moſt Loyaltie and Obedience, afore and above all Powers and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates on Earth;</hi> that for ſo doing, we ſhould be reproached as <hi>Time-ſervers,</hi> and ſuch as advance an <hi>Arbitrarie power;</hi> and that ſuch Doctrine <hi>is calculated and fitted on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the uſe of a Popiſh Succeſſour, and to make us an eaſier prey to the bloudie Papiſts,</hi> p. 89. And all this, by thoſe men who are <hi>equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged</hi> by <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> to do the ſame as we.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>theſe things</hi> the Author accuſeth a <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96115:148"/>Doctor,</hi> who had affirmed (in a Sermon I ſuppoſe, and he quotes <hi>p.</hi> 8.) <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth not preſcribe any remedie but flight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſecutions of the lawful Magiſtrate; allowing no other means, when we cannot eſcape, between denying and dying for the Faith.</hi> This is in <hi>p.</hi> 80. and <hi>p.</hi> 85. for ſaying, <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by its own confeſſion is a ſuffering Doctrine, and ſo far from being prejudicial to</hi> Caeſars <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that it makes him the Miniſter of God, and commands all its Profeſſors to give him and all that are in authoritie under him their dues, and rather die than reſiſt them by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to remove the <hi>prejudice</hi> of ſuch as are of our Author's Judgment, I ſhall firſt propoſe the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (as a preparative to the more candid entertainment of what I ſhall propound concerning <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi>) P. 24: of the 4th part of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Directorie,</hi> Direct. 31. <hi>Reſiſt not where you cannot obey; and let no appearance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable good that may come to your ſelves or to the Church, by any unlawful means, as Treaſon, Sedition, or Rebellion, ever tempt you to it: for,</hi> evil muſt not be done, that good may come by it.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sect.</hi> 61. it is objected, <hi>If we muſt let Rulers deſtroy us at their pleaſure, the Goſpel will be rooted out of the Earth: When they know we hold it unlawful to reſiſt them, they will
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96115:149"/>be emboldened to deſtroy us, and ſport themſelves in our bloud, as the Papiſts did by the poor</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes. Anſw. <hi>All this were ſomething, if there were no God that can eaſilier reſtrain and deſtroy them at pleaſure, than they can injure or deſtroy you. If God be engaged to protect you, and hath told you that the hairs of your head are numbered, and more regardeth his Honour, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and Church, than you do, and accounteth his Servants as the Apple of his eye, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to hear them, and avenge them ſpeedily; then it is but Atheiſtical diſtruſt of God, to ſave your ſelf by ſinful means, as if God could not or would not do it. Thus he that ſaveth his life ſhall loſe it.</hi>

               <p>This Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks againſt <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>unlawful Arms</hi> and <hi>Acts.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he quotes <hi>Grotius de Imperio,</hi> p. 210. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the <hi>like Objection,</hi> (viz.) Mutato Regis Animo, Religio Mutabitur; <hi>That if the King change his mind, the Religion will be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged alſo.</hi> Anſw. <hi>In this caſe the onely remedie is in the providence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath the hearts of all men in his hand, but eſpecially the Kings, God worketh his ends both by good and evil Kings: ſometime a calm, ſometime a ſtorm is moſt profitable to the Church. If the King be of a perverſe and corrupt Judgment, it will be worſe for him than for the Church.</hi> But all this, you will ſay, is againſt <hi>unlawful acts and means,</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:96115:149"/>which they that have the <hi>Laws on their ſide</hi> cannot be ſaid to uſe. To this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> anſwers, p. 26. <hi>What power the Laws have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have it by the Kings Conſent and Act. And it is ſtrange impudencie, to pretend that his own Laws are againſt him. If any miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them, he may be confuted.</hi> I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> means, by ſome <hi>other method</hi> than that of <hi>arguing,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> adviſed in the like caſe.</p>
               <p>The Law and Ordinance of <hi>Government,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> is founded on the Law of <hi>God</hi> and Nature; and no <hi>poſitive Laws,</hi> or <hi>condeſcentions of Governours,</hi> can make void the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For though a <hi>righteous Prince</hi> will not violate thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> which he hath conſented to, yet if he ſhould, it will not juſtifie thoſe <hi>Subjects</hi> that ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the Law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> in <hi>reſiſting</hi> and <hi>riſing up</hi> againſt him in <hi>Rebellion;</hi> which would as it were argue <hi>great ingratitude</hi> to them who by <hi>Acts of Grace</hi> have <hi>obliged</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: (for, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, our <hi>Prince,</hi> like <hi>God himſelf,</hi> becomes a <hi>Debtor</hi> to man, <hi>Non aliquid à nobis accipiendo, ſed omnia nobis largiendo;</hi> Not by receiving any thing from us, but by promiſing all good things to us.) So it is a certain way to bring us all to <hi>Confuſion,</hi> if the <hi>King</hi> ſhould be judged as a <hi>Criminal</hi> upon every <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi>

Which thus he doth: Firſt, he tells us the</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal <hi>of that Sentence,</hi> viz. <hi>from</hi> Cicero de Legibus, <hi>in theſe words, l. 3. Regio Imperio duo ſunto, iique praeeundo, judicando, conſulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, Praetores, Judices, Conſules appellantur: Militiae Summum Jus habento nemini paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Ollis Salus Populi Suprema Lex eſto.</hi> Now to whom doth this power belong? to them (ſays the very Letter of thoſe Laws) to whom the Imperial power was committed, that is, to the two Conſuls for the time being. Come now. <hi>(ſays the Biſhop)</hi> all you that are the Patrons of <hi>Popular confidence,</hi> read, weigh, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

Doth not the whole ſeries both of Things and Words loudly proclaim, that the Supream Authoritie which is above all Law, and that the care of the Publick ſafetie proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs to him alone to whom the Imperial power, the right of the Militia, and that Supream Authoritie which is ſubject to none, is granted?</p>
               <p>When the Law commands one thing. (<hi>ſays</hi> Aeneas Sylvius, <hi>de Ortu Imperii,</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi>) and Equity another, it is fit the Emperour ſhould temper the rigour of the Law with the bridle of Equity. Seeing no Decree of the Law, though made by never ſo deliberate advice, can ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer the various and unthought-of plottings of mans nature— and it is manifeſt that the Laws which aforetime were juſt, in after-times may prove unjuſt, harſh, and unprofitable; to moderate which, it is needful that the Prince, who is Lord of the Laws, interpoſe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And where it is ſaid, that a Law, though it be ſevere, ſhould be obſerved; this reſpects inſeriour Magiſtrates, not the Emperour, to whom the power of moderating the Laws is ſo connexed, that by no decrees of man it can be pull'd from him.</p>

                  <hi>Biſhop</hi> Sanderſon <hi>gives a pertinent inſtance

                  <hi>To conclude, it is the judgement both of</hi> Divines, Civilians, <hi>and</hi> Stateſ-men, <hi>that there muſt be in</hi> Kings <hi>and</hi> Governours <hi>a</hi> Supream Power <hi>to</hi> mitigate <hi>the</hi> rigour <hi>of the</hi> Laws, <hi>and to</hi> ſuſpend <hi>the</hi> execution <hi>of them; to pardon ſome Delinquents, and in caſe of neceſſity to provide for the</hi> ſafety of the People, <hi>beſides, and againſt the Laws: and that to</hi> arm <hi>the People, and teach them on pretence of the</hi> Law <hi>to</hi> reſist <hi>their Prince, is a pernicious Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, deſtructive to Government.</hi>

                  <hi>The firſt</hi> Reformers <hi>of our Religion, in</hi> the Inſtitution of a Chriſtian man, <hi>on the</hi> Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>ſay,</hi> That Subjects be bound not to withdraw their Fealtie, Truth, Love, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from their prince FOR ANY CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE WHATSOEVER IT BE; ne for any cauſe may they conſpire against his perſon, ne do any thing towards the hinderance or hurt thereof, or of his eſtate: And by his Commandment they are bound to obey all the Laws, Proclamations, Precepts, and Commandments made by their Princes and Governours, except they be againſt the Commandment of God.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96115:154"/>their Prince, as far as he will have them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.

And there be many examples in Scripture of the vengeance of God that hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LERS and ſuch as have been diſobedient to their Princes. But one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal example to be noted, is of the Rebellion of <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> made againſt their Governours <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> For puniſhment of which Rebels, God not onely cauſed the Earth to open, and to ſwallow them down, and a great number of other people with them, with their houſes, and all their ſubſtance; but cauſed alſo a fire to deſcend from Heaven, and to burn up two hundred and fiftie Captains which conſpired with them in the Rebellion.</p>

                  <hi>The</hi> Scars <hi>that</hi> Souldiers <hi>receive in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their</hi> Prince, <hi>are eſteemed</hi> Marks <hi>of</hi> Honour: <hi>and every</hi> pettie Prince <hi>can lead forth</hi> Legions <hi>to look</hi> Death in the face <hi>at his command: Every</hi> new Sect <hi>can boaſt of their</hi> Dipticks <hi>and</hi> Martyrologies; <hi>and there is</hi> ſcarce a good man <hi>in the world, but ſome or other would</hi> even dare to die <hi>for him: And what difficulties do affright</hi> men of reſolution, <hi>when they contend but for a</hi> Garland of Flowers <hi>or</hi> Laurel, <hi>fading and unſatisfactorie rewards! And hath</hi> our bleſſed Redeemer <hi>onely ſo ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of us for all the great things that he hath done both for our Souls and Bodies? or is he only ſo unable to requite our</hi> ſervice <hi>and</hi> labour of love, <hi>that we ſhould forſake him, when a</hi> ſmall Storm <hi>threatneth us, or falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our heads?

               <p>
                  <hi>It is no raſh, fruitleſs, or deſperate deſigne that our Saviour calls us to: He forewarned
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96115:157"/>us at our firſt entrance to our Holy Profeſſion, that we</hi> could not be his Diſciples except we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our ſelves, and take up the Croſs and follow him: <hi>and</hi> he that doth not ſo, <hi>ſaith our Saviour,</hi> is not worthy of me, <hi>Matth. 10.38. Matth. 16.24. Luke 14.27. Nor is it fruitleſs: he hath wiſe and great ends, not onely for the glorie of his</hi> Father, <hi>but the good of his</hi> Church, <hi>in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very affliction: that</hi> Vine, <hi>as well as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones, ſpreads and proſpers the</hi> more, <hi>when it is at the wiſdom of the Vine-dreſſer wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with</hi> blood. <hi>As in leſſer afflictions</hi> God chaſtiſeth us for our good, that we may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Holineſs; <hi>ſo doth he with greater, that he may</hi> bring us to glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many a man might have periſhed eternally, if they had not periſhed temporally; God by his Righteous judgments</hi> calling their ſins to remembrance, <hi>and working in them</hi> repentance unto life. Behold, <hi>ſaith St.</hi> James, we count them happy that endure. You have heard of the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and have ſeen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pittiful, and of tender mercy. Jobs <hi>Graces had not given ſo great a light and ground of</hi> Conſolation <hi>to the world, if they had not been tryed in the fire of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is ſo needful for the</hi> purging out <hi>our</hi> Corruption, <hi>that we are told<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution; <hi>and that</hi> we must through Many tribulations
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96115:158"/>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Afflictions <hi>which God ſends do often bear an</hi> Inſcription <hi>of thoſe</hi> ſins <hi>that procured them: as when</hi> Joſephs <hi>brethren were under apprehenſion of</hi> great fear, they ſaid one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, We are verily guilty concerning our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that we ſaw him in the anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear him. <hi>If we are oppreſt and perſecuted by our</hi> own Country-men <hi>and</hi> falſe brethren, <hi>let us conſider whether we have not been ſuch, and dealt ſo with our Brethren. If God permit us to be perſecuted by a</hi> Chriſtian Prince, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what guilt yet lieth on the Nation for the</hi> Perſecution <hi>and</hi> Murther <hi>of a</hi> moſt Chriſtian King; <hi>and learn to improve the Judgment into a Mercy, by</hi> repentance <hi>and</hi> patience <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods afflicting hand. If no ſuch guilt lies upon us, then think that God calls us forth as</hi> Combatants, <hi>to ſhew examples of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, Love, <hi>and</hi> Reſolution, <hi>in an Age that is</hi> corrupted <hi>by</hi> long proſperity, <hi>and become</hi> effeminate <hi>and</hi> delicate, <hi>through</hi> plenty <hi>and</hi> luxury: <hi>and a</hi> Plethory <hi>is to be cured by</hi> Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How the</hi> Church thrived <hi>under</hi> Perſecution, <hi>we have many inſtances. The</hi> firſt Perſecution <hi>ſcattering the</hi> Diſciples, <hi>cauſed the Goſpel to be planted</hi> through the world; <hi>and being planted, the bloud of thoſe that dyed made it
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96115:158"/>ſo fruitful, that the Preſident of</hi> Palestine <hi>wrote to</hi> Tiberius, <hi>that</hi> they were weary of ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; who never ſo much as fled or hid themſelves, and yet multiplyed the more for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to death. Pliny <hi>alſo writing to</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan, <hi>complains,</hi> prope jam deſolata templa, &amp; ſacra Solennia diu intermiſſa. <hi>It was otherwiſe when the Church</hi> flouriſhed outwardly <hi>in the days of</hi> Constantius: <hi>the Chriſtians drove one another</hi> from the Altars, <hi>and by their</hi> ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>and</hi> popular Conteſts, <hi>made the</hi> Sacrifices of God <hi>to be</hi> abominated by the heathen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatever the</hi> puniſhment <hi>be, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it as the</hi> demerit <hi>of our</hi> Sins, <hi>and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by a moſt righteous and glorious God. And if becauſe, as in the days of</hi> Conſtantius, <hi>we denie the</hi> power of godlineſs, <hi>and exerciſe of</hi> Charity <hi>to one another, it is juſt with God to deprive us of the very</hi> form <hi>of it, and commit us to be</hi> Chastiſed <hi>by a</hi> common Enemy, <hi>as they were by</hi> Julian; <hi>We muſt</hi> bear the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, becauſe we have ſinned againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider what Chriſt</hi> ſuffered for us; <hi>he</hi> endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame; <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> now at the right hand of God, <hi>calls on us to</hi> follow his Example, <hi>promiſing, that</hi> if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him. <hi>And ſhall our Saviour be</hi> forſaken <hi>as ſoon as he is</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, <hi>and be again called on to</hi> come down
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96115:159"/>from the Croſs, that we may believe in him? <hi>ſhall we draw back, as the beaſts were wont, from that Altar which our Saviour hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and made our ſureſt Sanctuary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Evils?</hi> Think it not ſtrange, <hi>ſaith St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>1.4.12.</hi>) concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as if ſome ſtrange thing had hapned to you; but rejoyce, in as much as you are made partakers of Christs ſufferings; that when his Glory ſhall appear ye may be glad with exceeding joy. <hi>Would our Saviour have bid us to</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be exceeding glad <hi>when we</hi> ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for his ſake, <hi>if it were a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that</hi> as Afflictions do abound ſo our Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>ſhall alſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With what an</hi> Emphaſis <hi>doth the Spirit of God deſcribe the bleſſedneſs of them that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or die for the ſake of Chriſt! 1</hi> Pet. <hi>4.14.</hi> the Spirit of God and of Glory <hi>(i. e. the glorious Spirit of God)</hi> resteth on you: <hi>and verſ. 15.</hi> If any man ſuffer as a Christian, let him not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf. <hi>And ſo St.</hi> John, Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord for they rest from their labours, and their works follow them, <hi>Revel. 14.13.</hi> Be thou faithful unto death <hi>(to the ſuffering of death)</hi> and I will give thee a Crown of life, <hi>Revel. 2.10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we did indeed believe all that to be</hi> true <hi>which our Saviour hath told us, we would not
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96115:159"/>be</hi> offended at the Croſs. <hi>The</hi> growth <hi>of our</hi> fears, <hi>is from the</hi> decay <hi>of our</hi> Faith: Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith! Abraham, <hi>who was</hi> ſtrong in Faith, <hi>was alſo perſwaded that what God had</hi> promiſed, <hi>he was able to</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, <hi>and therefore</hi> offered up his onely Son, <hi>who was dearer than his own life; and left his</hi> Country <hi>and</hi> Kindred <hi>at the Command of God. This was the</hi> Victory <hi>whereby the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Worthies</hi> overcame <hi>a world of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> even their Faith, <hi>that Faith that gave a</hi> ſubſiſtence to things to come, <hi>and</hi> apprehended them as preſent: <hi>that Faith that made them</hi> look through things Temporal <hi>to</hi> things Eternal. <hi>They could, as the</hi> Proto-martyr <hi>St.</hi> Stephen, ſee the heavens opened, and Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God; <hi>Et quid pulchrius Deo ſpectaculum, quam Chriſtianus cum dolore congreſſus, quum adverſum minas, ſupplicia, &amp; tormenta, componitur! No ſpectacle is more pleaſing to God, than a well-compoſed Chriſtian conflicting with puniſhments and torments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt as it were leaves his ſeat, and ſtands up, not onely to</hi> behold, <hi>but to</hi> encourage <hi>and</hi> aſſist <hi>ſuch Combatants.</hi> Non enim nos ſpectat tantum, ſed in nobis ipſe luctatur. <hi>And when Chriſt takes all that is done to his</hi> Members <hi>as done to</hi> himſelf; <hi>when</hi> in all their afflictions he is afflicted; <hi>when he aſſures us as by his Word
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96115:160"/>and Oath, that he will</hi> never leave us nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us; <hi>And that</hi> all things ſhall co-operate to our good: <hi>If</hi> the love of Chriſt <hi>were indeed</hi> ſhed abroad in our hearts, <hi>it would</hi> conſtrain us <hi>to do and ſuffer</hi> any thing <hi>that he ſhall call or command us to do or ſuffer. For</hi> there is no fear in love: perfect love will cast out <hi>all baſe</hi> fears. <hi>Love would ſo unite us to him whom we love, that as</hi> nothing <hi>could on Chriſts part</hi> ſeparate us from his love; <hi>ſo neither would any thing on our part work a</hi> ſeparation, <hi>Rom. 8.38.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And what is there in the</hi> world, <hi>or in</hi> our ſelves, <hi>of ſuch weight, as the</hi> full enjoyment <hi>of our</hi> Saviour <hi>may not outweigh! here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but</hi> ſin <hi>and</hi> miſery, infirmities <hi>and</hi> tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>daily aſſaulting us, and leading us Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. The very</hi> Heathen, <hi>that had no hopes of a</hi> better life, <hi>ſaw cauſe to be weary of</hi> this, <hi>and eſteemed it</hi> the greatest bleſſing, not to be born; but the next to it, to die ſpeedily. <hi>But to us</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>to whom</hi> Cita mors eſt victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria laeta, <hi>death ſhould be eſteemed a gain; it is a paſſage from a</hi> vale of tears, <hi>to a</hi> Crown <hi>and</hi> Kingdom, <hi>where</hi> we ſhall be ever with the Lord.

               <head>AN APPENDIX, Containing A more full and particular Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hunt's</hi> Preface and Poſtſcript.</head>
               <p>THe Author of the <hi>life of Julian</hi> having taken his Meaſures and <hi>chief Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> from the late <hi>Libels</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> and both of them their whole <hi>Scheme</hi> from <hi>John Milton</hi>'s <hi>Defence</hi> of that moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Murther committed on the <hi>Royal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> by thoſe whom he calls <hi>the People of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who were indeed the very <hi>ſcum</hi> and <hi>off-ſcouring,</hi> the <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>peſts</hi> of the Nation; I ſhall make my way to the Confutation of the firſt, by ſome Remarks on the Writings of the other. And whereas I did onely occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally reflect on ſome paſſages of the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> in my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Life of Julian;</hi> I ſhall now more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thoſe other <hi>ſeditious</hi> and <hi>treaſonable
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:96115:161"/>Writings</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hunt.</hi> which ſince came to my hand.</p>
               <p>The firſt Pamphlet which I have anſwered in the precedent Papers, is, <hi>the Life of Julian.</hi> He begins his <hi>Preface</hi> to the Reader with a ſtory of <hi>Mahomets Horns,</hi> half <hi>Fire</hi> and half <hi>Snow;</hi> which by altering the phraſe he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from a parallel expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s upon the like occaſion: for he compares the <hi>Addreſſers</hi> to thoſe <hi>pleaſant Knaves that cry with one ſide of the face, and laugh with the other,</hi> Poſtſcr. p. 13. And to <hi>him that acted a grave Spaniard with one ſide of his body, and a brisk French-man with the other.</hi> This drew on his conceit of <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines;</hi> and it was very eaſie by ſo ſtrong a <hi>Chain of thoughts</hi> as our Author hath, to paſs from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Turky;</hi> with the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of which Country he ſeems <hi>better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,</hi> than with that of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> or elſe he would never have compared the Doctrine of the <hi>Croſs</hi> with the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Bow-ſtring,</hi> p. 8. of his Preface.</p>
               <p>But ſure he ſtretcht his <hi>Chain</hi> very much, when from the <hi>Addreſs</hi> of the <hi>men of Rippon,</hi> thanking his Majeſtie for his <hi>Declaration to govern by Laws,</hi> and to <hi>maintain the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion,</hi> and to <hi>call frequent Parliaments,</hi> and deſiring that the <hi>Crown</hi> might deſcend in the <hi>right Line;</hi> he concludes, that <hi>they prayed
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96115:161"/>againſt all theſe,</hi> and made it their humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt <hi>that they might be ſure of a Popiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,</hi> and <hi>were weary of their Religion,</hi> p. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>But he broke every <hi>link</hi> of this <hi>Chain,</hi> when (though he put on his <hi>conſidering-Cap</hi>) he could not find any <hi>Precedent</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> for <hi>ſuch an Addreſs.</hi> But preſently had <hi>an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect remembrance</hi> (for ſuch indeed it was) of the <hi>contrary Carriage</hi> of tho <hi>Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans towards</hi> Julian: whereas our Author might more <hi>eaſily</hi> and <hi>fitter to his purpoſe,</hi> have remembred the Behaviour of <hi>ſome other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> (as they profeſſed themſelves) towards King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; and then he might have deſerved the Office of a <hi>City-Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he <hi>wickedly,</hi> and (I hope by what I ſhall diſcover) <hi>in vain</hi> endeavours <hi>to</hi> impoſe his <hi>Seditious Doctrine</hi> on the Nation. For this <hi>Notorious Plagiary</hi> hath taken his <hi>whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> had done before him) from an <hi>Argument</hi> of that <hi>profligate Villain, John Milton,</hi> whereby he attempted to <hi>defend</hi> the Murther of our <hi>Royal Martyr:</hi> and that <hi>ſome paſſages</hi> in the <hi>Life of Julian</hi> have the <hi>ſame malignant aſpect</hi> and <hi>influence,</hi> I have ſhewn in my Obſervations on a paſſage quoted by our Author out of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> in commendation of <hi>Regicide.</hi> So that his <hi>Chain of Thoughts</hi> will
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96115:162"/>hang no more together than a <hi>Rope of Sand:</hi> for he runs ſo far from the <hi>Loyal Addreſſers,</hi> as to fall in with <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Regicides.</hi> His whole deſign is to juſtifie <hi>Reſiſtance of Lawful Powers</hi> in <hi>defence</hi> of that <hi>Religion</hi> which we <hi>profeſs</hi> and <hi>allow of,</hi> eſpecially when we are <hi>in poſſeſſion</hi> of that Religion, and it is <hi>eſtabliſhed by Law:</hi> (though by the way, both the <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, as well as the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reſiſtance.)</p>
               <p>This <hi>Leviathan</hi> fancying to himſelf <hi>a wide difference</hi> between the Caſe of <hi>thoſe Chriſtians</hi> that lived <hi>under Julian,</hi> and the Caſe of the <hi>firſt Chriſtians,</hi> ſports himſelf in the depth of this great Invention, and ſcoffs at all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought for <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> from the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> before <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> as the Leviathan in <hi>Job</hi> 41. who <hi>eſteemed Iron as Straw, and Braſs as rotten wood, and laugheth at the ſhaking of the Spear. Their caſe</hi> (ſaith he of the Chriſtians in <hi>Julians</hi> time) <hi>and that of the Primitive Chriſtians, was as widely different, as Laws for men and againſt men can poſſibly make them:</hi> Yet for ought I ſee, be the Laws for or againſt his <hi>Doctrine of Reſiſtance,</hi> it muſt be ſwallowed; for though he tells us that <hi>our Laws</hi> do not admit of <hi>ſuch thoughts</hi> as his <hi>Julian Chriſtians</hi> did put in practice, yet the deſign muſt on, or the whole
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96115:162"/>labour of our Author muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>And who can help it? when men will build on the <hi>Sand,</hi> and <hi>daub with untempered Mortar,</hi> ſuch as <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſlime,</hi> whatever <hi>coſt</hi> or <hi>time</hi> is beſtowed on ſuch a <hi>Fabrick,</hi> is caſt away, and the <hi>fall</hi> of it will be <hi>great.</hi> On this <hi>falſe ſuppoſition</hi> theſe two <hi>Maſter-builders,</hi> with whom I am now accounting, do with an <hi>unaccountable Confidence</hi> lay the <hi>ſtreſs</hi> of all their Diſcourſes. And though I have ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deſtroy this <hi>falſe Hypotheſis</hi> in the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> yet becauſe they think to <hi>ſuperſede</hi> the Arguments brought for <hi>Obedience,</hi> from the practice of the <hi>firſt Chriſtians</hi> for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and perſwade the <hi>preſent Age</hi> that they do not at all concern us, but that we may rather do as the <hi>Julian Chriſtians</hi> did, that is, <hi>rail at</hi> and <hi>reſiſt</hi> our <hi>Superiours,</hi> having our Religion <hi>eſtabliſhed by Law,</hi> though both our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> declare preciſely that we <hi>may not reſist, for any pretence whatſoever;</hi> I ſhall add ſomewhat here to <hi>prevent</hi> that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> and <hi>preoccupation</hi> which <hi>our Authors</hi> have <hi>falſly</hi> and <hi>maliciouſly</hi> inſinuated, And to this end, I ſhall prove, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> time were under <hi>the ſame Government</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> (abſtracted from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion) with thoſe of the <hi>firſt three hundred years;</hi> and if they had <hi>reſisted,</hi> it was altogether as <hi>unjuſtifiable</hi> as that of thoſe <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive

                  <hi>Cicero</hi> acquaints us wherein the Imperial Power did conſiſt when it was firſt founded among the <hi>Romans,</hi> l. 3. <hi>de Legibus,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Regio Imperio duo ſunto, iique prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eundo, judicando, conſulendo, Praetores, Judices, Conſules appellantor: Militiae Summum jus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bento, nemini parento: Ollis ſalus Populi Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Lex eſto.</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Let there be two perſons in the Royal Empire, and let them be called from their precedence Praetors, from their Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature Judges, from their Conſultations Conſuls: Let them have the higheſt command of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia: Let them obey no man: Let the ſafety of the people be to them the Supream Law.</hi> How this latter Clauſe is to be underſtood, is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved in the <hi>preceding Diſcourſe.</hi> But all theſe do certainly amount to an <hi>Abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable power,</hi> which being <hi>first</hi> ſetled in the <hi>two Conſuls,</hi> was <hi>afterward</hi> by the Senate conferred on <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and called the <hi>Lex Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia;</hi> by which it was declared, that <hi>(Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid per Epiſtolam ſtatuit, cognoſcens decrevit, aut per Edictum propalavit, Lex eſto) Whatever he ſhould determine by his Epiſtle, whatever he ſhould decree upon Cognizance, or declare by his Edict, ſhould be a Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This very <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> lived

               <p>But granting that he had to the utmoſt of his power <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> yet his <hi>Succeſſor</hi> thought himſelf not at all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged by his <hi>Edicts:</hi> for, by the <hi>ſame Reaſon</hi> that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſhould be bound by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of <hi>Conſtantine, Conſtantine</hi> ſhould be bound by the Edicts of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> for the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But, as our Author hath obſerved from <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who ſpeaking of <hi>Julian</hi>'s <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who (were moſt of them <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and yet beſides the Law of God) <hi>knew no other Law than the Will of their Prince.</hi> Invective 1. p. 75.

               <p>The weight of theſe and thoſe other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which follow, will I doubt not ſink that Triumphant Arch which our Author hath raiſed, into thoſe Quick-ſands on which he grounded it.

               </p>
               <p>It hath been accounted a good method for refuting of Errours, to reduce them to their firſt Principles and Originals. Be it known then to all men, that our Author hath <hi>bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> in teaching the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> which was <hi>never taught</hi> among any <hi>Chriſtians</hi> until <hi>Popery</hi> was come to its perfection. That he hath as much as in him lierh, <hi>ſcandalized</hi> and even <hi>condemned</hi> the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</hi> and <hi>practiſing</hi> that <hi>intolerable Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Reſiſtance.</hi> That both he and Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> have <hi>defended</hi> this Doctrine by the <hi>ſame Arguments
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96115:165"/>as the Jeſuits, John Milton,</hi> and <hi>other Regicides</hi> have done. That <hi>John Milton,</hi> &amp;c. received the ſame Principles from Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burroughs, Bridge, Marſhal,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the late <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural War</hi> againſt <hi>Charles the Firſt.</hi> That their <hi>deſign</hi> is to raiſe <hi>another War,</hi> on the <hi>ſame grounds,</hi> againſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Prince. And though they ſeem to blind their deſigns by preparing onely to <hi>exclude</hi> a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> yet 'tis beyond denial, that all the <hi>Arguments</hi> of the <hi>Author of Julian</hi> are levelled againſt the <hi>Prince that is in poſſeſſion,</hi> and that he doth with the ſhew of Authority recommend the aſſaſſination of ſuch a Prince, and that Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s <hi>Original</hi> far exceeds the <hi>Tranſcript</hi> in ſuch impious deſigns.</p>
               <p>If <hi>this Character</hi> be not <hi>black</hi> enough, let him that reads and underſtands, onely ſubſcribe the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Life of Julian</hi> with that of Mr. <hi>Hunt, In perpetuam Rei memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi> and you have all in two words.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> if <hi>this paſſage</hi> which I ſhall name do not amount to more <hi>direct Treaſon,</hi> than thoſe for which he ſays he would <hi>indite</hi> a <hi>great perſon</hi> (no leſs than a Secretary of State) of— Treaſon in a <hi>plea</hi> for the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion;</hi> I think there can be no ſuch thing. The Paragraph, p. 193. as it is marked in my Copy, is <hi>verbatim</hi> this: Speaking of the Duke— <hi>Let him attempt the Crown not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96115:166"/>an Act of Parliament for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he is all that while but attempting to make us miſerable: if he be not excluded, he doth it certainly, (we exclude onely his Perſon, not his Poſterity). And WE WILL NOT ENTAIL A WAR <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PON THE NATION, THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GH FOR THE SAKE AND INTEREST OF THE GLORIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S FAMILY OF THE ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ARTS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this ſpoken <hi>Dictator-like?</hi> Did <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> ſay more when he bragg'd that he had the <hi>Parliament in his pocket?</hi> Then, <hi>We will have this,</hi> and <hi>we will not have that;</hi> We <hi>will proclaim the Family of the Stuarts Traitors, and we will have our own will.</hi> His <hi>premiſe</hi> is <hi>this— If the Duke be not excluded, he doth certainly make us miſerable, by entailing a War upon the Nation:</hi> (which may be falſe, if the <hi>ancient Proverb</hi> be true (<hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12.) <hi>In the mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen:</hi> it was ſpoken when the <hi>knife</hi> was <hi>lifted up</hi> to make <hi>Iſaac</hi> a <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> (and we know that the <hi>burning buſh</hi> was not <hi>conſumed.</hi>) But the <hi>Concluſion</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt impious, <hi>We will not entail a War up-the Nation, though for the ſake and interest of the glorious Family of the</hi> Stuarts. To let paſs that <hi>Irony</hi> of <hi>THE GLORIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S FAMILY OF THE ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ARTS;</hi> The <hi>plain ſence</hi> of the words to a <hi>Logician</hi> is
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96115:166"/>this: <hi>Rather than not exclude the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>who will certainly make us miſerable, we will exclude the glorious Family of the</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts. This is as much as need to be ſaid at preſent, to cure the <hi>preiudice</hi> of a <hi>deluded and unthinking people,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> calls them</p>

               <p>The firſt is his <hi>Invective</hi> againſt the Clergy. This poureth forth <hi>flouds</hi> of <hi>Contempt</hi> upon the <hi>whole Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is his <hi>Juſtification</hi> of the late <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural War:</hi> and this Head breaths out an <hi>horrible</hi> and <hi>infectious ſtink.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:96115:167"/>
               <p>The third, his <hi>endeavour to promote another ſuch War</hi> as <hi>that</hi> was: And this Head caſteth out <hi>Firebrands</hi> and <hi>Swords,</hi> to <hi>alarm</hi> and <hi>arm</hi> all the <hi>Malecontents</hi> in the Nation, for a <hi>reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of their Governours.</p>
               <p>I know he doth not want his <hi>lurking holes</hi> and <hi>Subterfuges</hi> to hide theſe <hi>monſtrous defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:</hi> but all in vain, <hi>Treaſon will out;</hi> and <hi>Magna est veritas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; prevalebit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Head breaths out a <hi>contempt of the Clergie;</hi> to which he makes way by a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble</hi> that will rather <hi>aggravate</hi> than <hi>excuſe</hi> the Crime.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Author complains that his <hi>honest deſign</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>to ſerve the Church hath been by many perverted,</hi> p. 1. of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face:</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 5. that ſome have endeavoured to ſet his <hi>two Diſcourſes</hi> (viz. his <hi>Argument for Biſhops,</hi> and his <hi>Poſtſcript</hi>) <hi>at variance; that the first was written to ſet off the latter with ſome advantage, and that the Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to get from the Argument, a more pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable libertie of inveighing againſt the Church-men in the Poſtſcript.</hi> Habetis conſitentem Reum.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs the <hi>Argument</hi> did not effect that <hi>grateful Acknowledgement</hi> from the <hi>Biſhops</hi> which he expected. They knew him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to be a <hi>mercenary man,</hi> one that <hi>had</hi> or <hi>would</hi> write as much <hi>falſely against them,</hi> as he
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96115:167"/>had done <hi>truly for them,</hi> if it might tend to his <hi>better advantage;</hi> and therefore he was reſolved to <hi>pull down</hi> what he had <hi>built up,</hi> and to ſeek more <hi>beneficiary Patrons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore conſider <hi>who</hi> they were that thus <hi>reſented</hi> and <hi>complained</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 5. <hi>If it had been</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the conceit of the Popiſh Faction onely, and not alſo of thoſe Gentlemen whom I principally deſigned to ſerve, and in them the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here it is as plain, as if it had been written with a <hi>Sun-beam,</hi> that he means the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who were <hi>moſtly,</hi> if not <hi>onely,</hi> concerned in that <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how maliciouſly doth he ſuggeſt, that they were influenced by the <hi>Popiſh Faction!</hi> who, <hi>p.</hi> 6.

               <p>Is not this a <hi>ſtout Advocate</hi> for <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that tells the world, that thoſe of <hi>that Order</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely) are <hi>contemptible ſlaves,</hi> that have <hi>ſold their Libertie for Preferment;</hi> that they are <hi>corrupted in their Principles,</hi> to the <hi>ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96115:168"/>of our Government,</hi> and <hi>betraying the Rights of the people;</hi> and ſo <hi>debauched</hi> in their <hi>manners,</hi> as that <hi>they have leſſened their eſteem and authoritie with the people?</hi> Is not this the old <hi>Cenſor Morum,</hi> or <hi>Cato Redivivus?</hi> And is it poſſible that a <hi>learned man</hi> ſhould thus <hi>prevaricate</hi> and <hi>contradict</hi> himſelf ſo groſly, as it were in the ſame breath?</p>
               <p>Let not Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> think to evade this, and ſay he ſpeaks this of our <hi>younger Divines,</hi> (of which we ſhall hear enough by and by, to make all good mens <hi>ears tingle</hi> at the horrid <hi>falſehood</hi> of it): he ſpeaks this of the <hi>Order,</hi> and particularly of the <hi>dignified men</hi> of that <hi>Order;</hi> of theſe it is that he ſpeaks, <hi>p.</hi> 7. (for he is not yet come to his diſtinction of <hi>young</hi> and <hi>old Divines;</hi> thoſe that are <hi>inſlaved</hi> by the <hi>Preferment</hi> they have, and thoſe that ſeek <hi>Preferment</hi> by <hi>other arts,</hi> of which anon) That <hi>they lick up the Vomit of Popiſh Prieſts; and whatever is ſaid maliciouſly by them againſt the first Reformers,</hi> is daily repeated by (now come in) <hi>our young Clerks out of the Pulpit, with advantages of immodeſtie and indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But this unmerciful man hath not yet done laſhing our young Divines. P. 10. <hi>Too many
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96115:169"/>of the young Clergie</hi> (ſays our <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi>) <hi>do aſſiſt the Gentrie in their Loyal Debauches moſt ſcandalouſly, for the ſervice of the Church, and maintaining the honour of their Order. Theſe degenerate Levites are magnifying perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the priviledges of their Tribe, extolling their Order, yet in terms that diſgrace it; and by their lives they vilifie it.</hi> And now, like the <hi>old Perſecutors,</hi> he hath <hi>wearied himſelf,</hi> to torment <hi>poor Innocents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope our <hi>young Divines</hi> have yet ſo much of their <hi>Grammar-learning,</hi> (for the <hi>Subject</hi> is ſcarce capable of the more ſerious <hi>Stelliteuticks</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity-ſtudies</hi>) as to return ſome <hi>Reflections</hi> on the <hi>laborious Travels</hi> of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous <hi>Tom Coriat,</hi> and make him feel what it is, <hi>Ludere cum Sanctis,</hi> in our Lawyers Latine, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to <hi>play with Edge-tools.</hi> In the mean time, his <hi>own folly</hi> and <hi>impietie</hi> will <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> him, it being evident that Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> deals with the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> not onely as <hi>men</hi> uſe their <hi>Dogs,</hi> who feed them with <hi>a bit and a knock;</hi> but as <hi>Butchers</hi> are wont to uſe their <hi>Hogs,</hi> who <hi>claw</hi> them and <hi>ſcrape</hi> them a little, that they may with more conveniencie <hi>cut their Throats:</hi> He advanceth them as it were on a <hi>Pinacle of the Temple,</hi> that he may <hi>caſt them down</hi> the more irrecoverably.</p>
               <p>He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 15. that <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and <hi>P. du Moulin,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Moyne, Claude,</hi> and <hi>de
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96115:169"/>l'Angle</hi> highly <hi>approved</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Biſhops:</hi> And from <hi>Grotius,</hi> that <hi>Non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent res bonae damnari, quia ſunt qui iis abutun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: That good things ought not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe there are ſome that do abuſe them.</hi> Yet <hi>p.</hi> 11. he tells them alſo, <hi>the Apoſtolicalneſs of their Order will not ſecure it, if they do not fill up the dutie of their Office,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> if they do not fully <hi>comply</hi> with <hi>his deſigne:</hi>) And <hi>p.</hi> 12. he <hi>remembers them that there are Churches of Chriſt that do make a ſhift without their Order, and Religion need not periſh though the Order fail.</hi> So that it is plain, that by the word <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> he means <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and inſinuates, that it is a <hi>needleſs thing,</hi> it may be <hi>grub'd up root and branch.</hi> And is not this a <hi>fair Apologie</hi> for his <hi>real intention</hi> to <hi>ſerve</hi> the Biſhops?</p>
               <p>P. 23. He complains that <hi>too many eminent men in our Church are brought to a dead Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralitie;</hi> and thereby we are brought <hi>to this paſs, That Religion it ſelf muſt be the devoted thing to the rage and folly of the Prieſts of that Religion:</hi> (As if they had all conſpired to be <hi>felo's de ſe</hi>). And on this ground he proclaims his <hi>Curſe ye Meroz</hi> againſt them as <hi>execrable Neuters.</hi> P. 6. he ſays, <hi>They have raiſed a bitter Zeal againſt that Separation which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have contrived, fomented, and promoted: and it is brought to that paſs, that thoſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Church-Fanaticks, though Conformiſts,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:96115:170"/>that cannot contentedly ſee and endure the neerer approaches of ruine both of Church and State: Theſe are their fear and their hate, the Sons of</hi> Anak, <hi>the Giants of the Land, that they imagine ſo inſuperable, that they are for making themſelves a Captain, and returning back into</hi> Egypt, <hi>p.</hi> 7. This he repeats, <hi>p.</hi> 46. where he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to lay the ſin of <hi>Corah.</hi> &amp;c. upon <hi>thoſe</hi> who in our days do moſt <hi>faithfully adhere</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and would excuſe thoſe, who having loſt their <hi>Corah</hi> and other <hi>renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> Leaders, by an exemplary <hi>Divine Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> did the very next day murmur again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> falſely accuſing them, who were the <hi>meekeſt men upon Earth,</hi> of <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king too much upon them,</hi> (i. e.) of ruling by <hi>an Arbitrary power,</hi> and making themſelves <hi>abſolute:</hi> For ſo, <hi>v.</hi> 13. of that 16th Chapter, they accuſe <hi>Moſes</hi> of ſeeking to <hi>make himſelf altogether a Prince:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 14. he is accuſed of ſeeking to <hi>put out the eyes of the People,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> alſo doth, <hi>p.</hi> 13. Poſtſcr. <hi>We are uſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as</hi> Sampſon, <hi>bound, and our eyes put out, and made ſport for the Philiſtimes.</hi> I fear Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> will hardly have his eyes <hi>opened,</hi> till (as the <hi>mole</hi>) he comes to die. With ſuch <hi>murmurings</hi> as theſe they ſo provoked <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>the Lord was angry with him for their ſakes;</hi> and, as the Author of <hi>Julian</hi>'s life ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:96115:170"/>time, they <hi>contrived</hi> and <hi>effected</hi> his death: for he dyed in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> and was not to enter into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who they are that <hi>murmur</hi> at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> is too viſible to be denied <hi>(viz.)</hi> they that <hi>accuſe them</hi> of <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government,</hi> that proclaim <hi>themſelves</hi> the <hi>Holy People;</hi> they who hearken to thoſe <hi>falſe Spies</hi> that <hi>diſcourage</hi> the people with ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Inſuperable evils,</hi> of being <hi>certainly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,</hi> and having a <hi>War entailed on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fire</hi> and <hi>faggot,</hi> and an <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> &amp;c. For my part, I think theſe murmuring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticators are they who are for making <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Captain</hi> in the room of <hi>Corah,</hi> and going back again to <hi>Egypt.</hi> And though we do not look on theſe as <hi>the Sons of Anak,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Giants; yet are they as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were to <hi>Iſrael, thorns in our ſides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are ſtill troubling us with their <hi>wiles</hi> and their <hi>lyes,</hi> their <hi>Aſſociations</hi> and <hi>Conſults,</hi> their <hi>Seditious Libels</hi> and <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> ſuch as theſe of our two Authors; their <hi>Doleman,</hi> and <hi>the Rights of the Kingdom;</hi> Their <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> their <hi>No Plot,</hi> and Sermons of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> and <hi>Daniel in the Den;</hi> which, like the <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Plagues</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are <hi>croaking</hi> in <hi>every corner,</hi> and infecting <hi>every part</hi> of the <hi>three Nations.</hi> They which cry up thoſe for the <hi>godly Party,</hi> and <hi>devout Men,</hi> that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96115:171"/>with <hi>Scruples</hi> from God himſelf, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to put <hi>a bar</hi> againſt the <hi>proceedings</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſuch <hi>men</hi> and <hi>means</hi> (the truth is) we are brought into a <hi>great ſtrait;</hi> we have a <hi>deep Sea before us,</hi> and <hi>a howling Wilderneſs behind us.</hi> And yet we murmur not; our Sins have deſerved theſe things: Nor do we think of making <hi>any other</hi> Captains to our ſelves, than thoſe whom God in <hi>great mercy,</hi> and by <hi>many Miracles,</hi> hath preſerved and continued unto us. We are not for <hi>Egypt</hi> in your ſence, nor for being reduced to a <hi>State of Bondage</hi> through the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of a <hi>new War:</hi> We are for <hi>ſtanding ſtill,</hi> keeping our places, and <hi>doing</hi> our duties, and <hi>wait for the Salvation of God.</hi> Though we were by the wickedneſs of <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>cruel men</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of our <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet God hath ſent us a <hi>Joſua,</hi> and <hi>with him are the Prieſts of the Lord, and the Ark of his Covenant,</hi> to which, we doubt not, the ſwelling ſtreams of <hi>Jordan</hi> will <hi>give way,</hi> and we ſhall yet paſs to <hi>Canaan</hi> on dry land. Now let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge who do <hi>abuſe the Scripture to ſerve their turn,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> doth adviſe, p. 46.</p>
               <p>P. 35. Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> becomes an Advocate for a ſort of <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> that they may have an act of <hi>Comprehenſion;</hi> and repreſents them as a very <hi>harmleſs</hi> and <hi>friendly</hi> people. <hi>The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>

But though ſome profeſs an <hi>irreconcileable hatred,</hi> even in their <hi>pleas for Peace;</hi> the great queſtion is, what their <hi>practice is</hi> and <hi>hath been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poſtſcr. <hi>p.</hi> 89. <hi>Can any man imagine</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that any prejudice can accrew to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>if ſhe did enlarge her Communion by making the Conditions of it more eaſie?</hi> And p. 90. <hi>Is it fit that the Peace ſhould be hazarded, or the Nation put with reaſon or without in fear of it; or a Kingdom turned into a Shambles, for a Ceremony or a Ritual in our publick Worſhip?</hi> &amp;c. What is it the <hi>Advocate</hi> of <hi>theſe men</hi> pleads for? hath he <hi>full inſtructions</hi> from his <hi>Clients?</hi> doth he <hi>know</hi> their <hi>minds,</hi> and what will give them <hi>ſatisfaction?</hi> What he <hi>contends</hi> for, hath by <hi>ſeveral men</hi> of the Church been <hi>granted</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why may not</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſtanding at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament be granted</hi>— <hi>And the ſigning with the Croſs in Baptiſm be diſpenſed with when deſired?</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:96115:172"/>When the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> have made ſome <hi>overtures</hi> for <hi>conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> theſe things, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> anſwers the firſt, that he made them <hi>ſibi &amp; ſuis,</hi> for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of himſelf and others of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; and without taking any notice of them in the <hi>latter,</hi> anſwers his Diſcourſe with <hi>ſcorn</hi> and <hi>contempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our <hi>Liturgie</hi> muſt alſo be altered for their ſakes: <hi>p.</hi> 91. you would have <hi>more Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe we have, not ſo long:</hi> though ſome complain they are <hi>too many</hi> and <hi>too ſhort</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

               </p>
               <p>And you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 35 and 36 of the <hi>Preface, That the King and States of the Realm will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer ſo excellent an Eccleſiaſtical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as we enjoy, to be ſubverted: Yet the Diſſenters project</hi> in Mr. <hi>Humphrey's Half-ſheet,</hi> intended to be preſented to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> doth certainly tend to her <hi>deſtruction,</hi> as hath been ſhewed <hi>elſewhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>States</hi> will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an <hi>alteration,</hi> you know the <hi>Biſhops</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: and if the <hi>States</hi> will not, and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> cannot, ought not they that would make themſelves <hi>wiſer than their Rulers</hi> to <hi>ſubmit,</hi> (notwithſtanding their <hi>ſcruples</hi> againſt a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>)

               </p>
               <p>P. 36. It is added— <hi>That abſurd Opinion that</hi> Dominium fundatur in gratia, <hi>is charged on thoſe that are for the Excluſion of the Duke: And they think that by pronouncing that abſurd piece of Latine, they have at once put to ſilence and ſhame all reaſons of Nature, Religion, and State that urge and require it.</hi>

               <p>We come now to the <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> which he hath told us was written for the ſake of our <hi>young Divines,</hi> thoſe <hi>good-natur'd Gentlemen,</hi> who doubtleſs will <hi>return</hi> his Civilities. His pretence is to anſwer ſome <hi>Objections</hi> that were made <hi>againſt them;</hi> but in truth, they are his own accuſations of them, which he <hi>proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes</hi> with all the <hi>might</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> he can, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>this ground,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Biſhops</hi> muſt be made <hi>out</hi> of them; and being <hi>ſo bad</hi> already, he hath foretold how much <hi>worſe</hi> it will be, when they ſell their <hi>Liberty</hi> for that <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid then, <hi>p.</hi> 1. (our <hi>Author</hi> knows by <hi>whom</hi>) <hi>That they affirm it to be in the power of a Prince by Divine Right to govern as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: That the power of the Laws is ſolely in him: That he may, if he pleaſe, uſe the conſent of Parliaments to aſſiſt the Reaſon of his Laws, when he ſhall give any; but it is a great conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention in Kings to give a Reaſon for what they do, and a diminution to their moſt unaccountable Prerogative: That they are for a Popiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor and no Parliament, and do as much as in them lies, give up our ancient Government and the Proteſtant Religion, the true Chriſtian Faith,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96115:174"/>to the abſolute Will of a Popiſh Succeſſor, giving him a Divine Right to extirpate Gods true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſhed among us by Law, and to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate our Government by his abſolute pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, after a little <hi>pauſe,</hi> having almoſt run himſelf <hi>out of breath</hi> to tell the Nation theſe <hi>Falſhoods,</hi> he thus inlargeth himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 2. That <hi>juſt now, when we are under the dread of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſor, ſome of our Clergie are illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Myſterie, That any Authoritie in the Government, not derived from the King, and that is not to yield to his abſolute Will, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, and againſt the Divine Right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Kings in the eſtabliſhment, against which no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage or Preſcription to the contrarie, or in abatement of it, is to be allowed.

               <p>
                  <hi>God hath not ſo left this Age and Church, but there is in it a great number in both the Holy Functions, who are perhaps as eminent in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarineſs of their lives, and as diligent in their labours, as hath been in any one Church in any Age ſince Miracles ceaſed. The humility and ſtrictneſs of life in many of our Prelates, and ſome that were highly born, and yet have far outgone ſome others from whom more might have been expected, raiſeth them far above cenſure, though perhaps not above envie. And when ſuch think not the daily inſtructing their Neighbours a thing below them, but do it with as conſtant a care as if they were to earn their Bread by it: when they are ſo affable to the meaneſt Clergie-men that come to them; when they are nicely ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96115:178"/>about thoſe whom they admit into Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo large in their Charities, that one would think they were furniſhed with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen ways; theſe things muſt needs raiſe great eſteem for ſuch Biſhops, and ſeem to give ſome hopes of better times. Of all this I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſpeak the more freely, ſince I am led to it by none of thoſe Bribes either of Gratitude, or Fear, or Hope, which are wont to corrupt men to ſay what they do not think. But I were much to blame, if in a Work that may perhaps live ſome time in the world, I ſhould onely find fault with what is amiſs, and not alſo acknowledge what is ſo very commendable and praiſe-worthy. And when I look into the inferiour Clergie, there are, chiefly about this great City of</hi> London, <hi>ſo many ſo eminent, both for the ſtrictneſs of their Lives, the conſtancie of their Labours, and plain way of Preaching, which is now perhaps brought to as great a perfection as ever was ſince men ſpoke as they received it immediately from the Holy Ghoſt; the great gentleneſs of their Deportment to ſuch as differ from them, their mutual love and charity, and in a word, for all the qualities that can adorn Miniſters or Chriſtians; that if ſuch a number of ſuch men cannot prevail with this debauched Age, this one thing to me looks more diſmally than all the other affrighting ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of our condition, That God having ſent ſo many faithful Teachers, their labours are ſtill ſo ineffectual.</hi>

               <p>P. 102. He ſays, <hi>That War would have been impoſſible, if the Churchmen had not maintained the Doctrine that Monarchie was</hi> Jure Divino, <hi>in ſuch a ſence that made the King Abſolute.</hi> This was a <hi>fiction</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxters;</hi> and through the Loins of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> they ſtrike at the <hi>King,</hi> as if that glorious <hi>Prince</hi> intended <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi> But <hi>that good Prince</hi> was far from any deſign of ruling by an <hi>Arbitrarie power:</hi> he had no <hi>Army,</hi> nor <hi>Mony</hi> to raiſe one; but by

               <p>But were there not ſome <hi>other Doctrines</hi> preached in thoſe days, which contributed <hi>more</hi> to the beginning of <hi>that War,</hi> than that of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Kings? What think you of the Doctrine of the <hi>lawfulneſs of Reſiſtance</hi> then <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>printed,</hi> under the <hi>ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> as now it is, by Mr. <hi>Marſhal, Burton?</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>To what tended this other Doctrine, That the <hi>Authoritie</hi> of the King was in the two Houſes, when they had frighted away his <hi>Perſon?</hi> That the King was <hi>Singulis major,</hi> but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis minor?</hi> That <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was an <hi>Antichriſtian Order,</hi> and <hi>to be ſtub'd up root and branch?</hi> That the <hi>King, Court,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> were deſigning to bring in <hi>Popery?</hi> That our <hi>Liturgy</hi> was but the <hi>Maſs-book</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
               <p>Theſe Doctrines, with ſuch <hi>Remonſtrances, Votes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> began that <hi>unhappy War;</hi> The <hi>Aſſociations</hi> made in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> ſeizing the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Magazines</hi> and <hi>Royal Navy,</hi> and anſwering all his <hi>Meſſages of Peace</hi> with <hi>reproaches</hi> of his <hi>Male-adminiſtrations;</hi> This is that which you call the <hi>Engliſh Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> When they ſent out <hi>Armies</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> him, when they had him <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and voted <hi>no more Addreſſes,</hi> they were, if you will believe <hi>them,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> his Majeſties <hi>most Humble and Loyal Subjects</hi> ſtill.

               <p>P. 20. <hi>Pref. There is little reaſon to charge the guilt of the unexpiable Murther of our late Excellent King— upon Presbyterie, which was not thought of here in</hi> England <hi>till the War was begun.</hi> And p. 21.

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96115:182"/>deteſtable Tragedy.</hi> If they did <hi>preach againſt</hi> his Murther out of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> why had they not <hi>preached againſt Fighting,</hi> and <hi>purſuing him with fire and ſword,</hi> where he might have <hi>fallen</hi> as one of his Subjects?

               <p>And as it was in the beginning of <hi>that War,</hi> ſo it is now, and by <hi>our Authors principles</hi> ſo it will <hi>be ever:</hi> they that with their lives and fortunes <hi>adhere</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi> though he be neither <hi>Apoſtate</hi> or <hi>Tyrant,</hi> are pronounced <hi>Rebels;</hi> And they who <hi>fight againſt him,</hi> on any pretence whatſoever, are the true <hi>Engliſh Loyaliſts.</hi> I would not have them called the <hi>true Proteſtants,</hi> leſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult</hi> over them, and prove themſelves <hi>more Loyal</hi> Subjects. It is another very memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s, p. 171. Speaking of the <hi>Bill of Excluſion: If this Bill do not paſs, they will take him for a wicked King too, and will ſay he hath no lawful Iſſue to ſucceed him, for his own Sins; and many other remarks of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they will make upon him.</hi> What he means by the word <hi>too,</hi> may be explained by the <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> which he ſpeaks of juſt before, and now of others <hi>too,</hi> that will count the King wicked, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>It is ſomewhat obſcure alſo to gueſs what he means, when he ſays, <hi>the paſſing of the Bill is the onely means of the Kings Salvation from their traiterous deſigns;</hi> and again, p. 172. <hi>If he will follow the Counſel of that excellent Bill, he may live long, and ſee good days.</hi> As if he could not be <hi>ſafe</hi> without it.

               <p>AS ſoon as he was Seven years old, he was committed to the Tuition of <hi>Mardonius</hi> an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> by whom he was put to learn <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> in the publick Schools of <hi>Conſtantinople.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96115:190"/>
                  <hi>Ecebolius</hi> taught him Rhetorick. <hi>Libanius</hi> the Heathen Philoſopher had a famous School at that time in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe Works <hi>Julian</hi> procured, and read with great delight: and in a little time becomes familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, often frequenting his School; and, as the manner of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Scholars was, he adventured to declaim pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly againſt the Chriſtians, and (<hi>p.</hi> 4.) our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> ſays <hi>he would diſpute hard with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in favour of the Heathen, pretending that he only tryed how he could hold the weaker ſide of a Queſtion.</hi>

                  <hi>having fooliſhly</hi> (he ſpeaks by <hi>Irony</hi>) <hi>obſerved their dictates, perſwaded me, being a Boy deſirous to learn, that if I would tread in their paths, I ſhould be better, not onely than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, but than my ſelf: And I (for what could I do elſe?) obeying my old Tutor, cannot change any thing, though I deſire it never ſo much. And I accuſe my ſelf that I did open a more free admiſſion to all the Vices of that old Man.</hi> For thus he taught me out of <hi>Plato: That Man is worthy of Honour who offends not; but he that deters others from offending, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of more than double Honour: The firſt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelf alone, the others to many: that brings the Delinquent before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; and if he alſo joyn in puniſhing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, this is a noble and complete Citizen, and may be called a Conquerour in the conflict of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> This and ſome other <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> wherein <hi>Julian</hi> perceived the generality of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be defective as to their practice, raiſed in him a great opinion of his <hi>Pagan Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;</hi> and from Lectures of <hi>Morality,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to learn more <hi>curious Arts.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Maximus</hi> an <hi>Epheſian Philoſopher</hi> (who was by <hi>Valentinian</hi> put to death for his <hi>Impoſtures</hi> and <hi>Magical Arts</hi>) taught <hi>Julian</hi> to caſt <hi>Nativities,</hi> and make <hi>Divinations;</hi> and initiated him to the Myſteries of <hi>Magick.</hi> And as if he had not enough of thoſe <hi>deviliſbs Arts,</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:96115:191"/>he ſollicites a Journey to <hi>Athens,</hi> pretending to ſee <hi>Greece,</hi> and to be acquainted with their Schools: where he grew into a familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the beſt of the <hi>Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> of that Age, which abounded with many that were excellent Moraliſts. A Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writer (<hi>Ammianus Marcell.</hi> l. 22. c. 3.) ſays, that <hi>Julian from the very firſt instructions of his childhood was given to the Worſhip of the Heathen Gods and Idols.</hi> It is no wonder, if having ſuch <hi>Tutors,</hi> he became zealouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the ſame.</p>
               <p>This was his ſtudy while his Brother <hi>Gallus</hi> was living: and as ſoon as he underſtood of his death, which was an unnatural, barbarous action, and raiſed <hi>great prejudices</hi> againſt the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> he was greatly diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and diligently inquired by thoſe who were skilled in <hi>Curious arts</hi> what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him.

And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was a true Prophet, when he told the Suffering Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that <hi>Julian</hi> was <hi>Nubecula cito tranſitura,</hi> a cloud that threatned a <hi>Storm,</hi> but would be ſoon <hi>blown over.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>While <hi>Julian</hi> was meditating againſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> his <hi>vain-glory</hi> ſpur'd him on to a War againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> intending to have added one Title more to himſelf, <hi>(viz.) Parthicus.</hi> And although he were diſſwaded from it by <hi>Saluſtius,</hi> and other his <hi>beſt Souldiers,</hi> (<hi>Amn.

               </p>
               <p>He was in his March preſented by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Souldiers with a <hi>great Lyon wounded to death;</hi> which portended the death of <hi>ſome great King,</hi> ſaith <hi>Marcellinus:</hi> but he took no notice of it. A Souldier alſo as he had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his two Horſes, was ſtruck dead, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, by <hi>Lightning;</hi> which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as an <hi>ill Omen:</hi> yet on he goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96115:199"/>
                  <hi>Perſia;</hi> and as ſoon as he had landed his Army in <hi>Perſia,</hi> he cauſed his Ships to be burnt, reſerving onely a few of the leaſt of them to ſerve as a Bridge over the Rivers that might hinder his March: which much <hi>offended</hi> his <hi>Souldierie,</hi> as arguing a <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of their <hi>valour,</hi> and cutting off all hopes of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</hi> in their <hi>greateſt neceſſitie.</hi> It hapned that in the <hi>firſt.

So that here was another <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> of <hi>Julian</hi>'s from one of his chief Gods, the God of <hi>War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The grand <hi>Battalia</hi> of the <hi>Perſians</hi> being at hand, <hi>Julian</hi> prepares for it; and in the preceding night he told ſome of his friends, that the <hi>publick Genius</hi> which he ſaw when he was <hi>ſaluted Emperour</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> appeared to him in a ſad poſture, and ſorry habit, paſſing by. He ſaw alſo an <hi>Exhalation</hi> in the form of a <hi>Torch</hi> falling to the ground; which he was afraid had been the Star <hi>Mars</hi> which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96115:199"/>him. His <hi>Aruſpices</hi> being conſulted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, diſſwaded him from that Battle, at leaſt for ſome hours: But he refuſed; and as ſoon as it was day, put his Army in order for a fight. The <hi>Perſians</hi> were as early as he; and falling on the Rear of the <hi>Roman</hi> Armie, put them to ſome diſtreſs: which <hi>Julian</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, made ſuch haſte to <hi>ſuccour</hi> them, that he took onely his <hi>Target,</hi> neglecting any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Armour;</hi> and by his <hi>ſeaſonable aſſiſtance</hi> recovered the <hi>fault,</hi> and repulſed the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and with hands lifted up, urged his men to purſue them, he himſelf being at the <hi>head</hi> of them, and on the very <hi>heels</hi> of his Enemies. In this Conflict he received his <hi>mortal Wound;</hi> a Javelin ſlightly wounding his Arm, pierced into his Side, and ſtuck in his Liver. From what hand it came, we have had occaſion to enquire already; and as for the report that he pluck'd it out, and threw it in the Air, with a <hi>Viciſti Galilaee,</hi> I find no great <hi>authoritie</hi> for it among the Writers of <hi>that Age.</hi> His wound being ſearched and dreſſed, the pain abated; and calling for his <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Horſe,</hi> reſolved to enter again into the fight: but his ſtrength failed him; and hearing that the place where he was wounded was called <hi>Phrygia,</hi> he remembring that it was foretold that he ſhould die in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> deſpaired of life, and about Midnight calling for a draught of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he drank it, and ſhortly after died.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>THe time of departing this life is (my Companions) now at hand; which as an honeſt and well-meaning Debtor, I gladly repay to Nature; not, as ſome belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with reluctancie and ſorrow; for by the common Opinion of Philoſophers I am ſufficiently inſtructed in how much more bleſſed condition the Soul is than the Bodie; and am ſatisfied, that when one paſſeth out of a worſe into a better eſtate, he ought to rejoyce, rather than to be troubled: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering alſo, that the Celeſtial Gods reward the moſt pious men with death, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reward of all others. I alſo am aſſured that it hapneth to me after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; leſt I ſhould fall under ſome heavie burthens, as I undergo, or do any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of my ſelf: having yet ever found by experience, that ſorrows and pains as they domineer over Cowards, ſo are eaſily overcome by Valiant perſons. Neither doth it repent me of my Actions, nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of any Wickedneſs afflict me, either committed at ſuch time as I lay in
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96115:200"/>the ſhade and in corners as I could, and ſtudied vertue; or ſince I came to the Government. I think I have kept my ſelf blameleſs and without blemiſh, as one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Gods above. —In times of Peace governing with moderation, not without good conſideration making either Offenſive or Defenſive Wars, though the iſſue were not always anſwerable: For the Celeſtial Powers alone have the Soveraignty of Events; concluding with my ſelf, that the end of Government is the advantage and ſafety of good Subjects. I have ever been (as you know) more inclined to Peace and Tranquillitie by the whole courſe of my actions; oppoſing Laſciviouſneſs, as that which corrupts both things and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and whitherſoever my Mother the Commonwealth, how imperiouſly ſoever, called me, though to never ſo dangerous a Poſt, there have I ſtood immovable, being accuſtomed to deſpiſe all fortuitous events. I will not be aſhamed to confeſs, that I have heretofore underſtood that I ſhould die in War: and therefore I adore and praiſe the eternal Divinity, that I periſh not by any Conſpiracie, nor languiſh through the pain of a Diſeaſe; nor am I condemned to death, <hi>(he thought it might have been upon his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death)</hi> but in the middle courſe of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:96115:201"/>my flouriſhing Glory, I have deſerved ſo renowned a paſſage out of this world. He is equally to be eſteemed a Coward, who deſireth to die when he ought to live, as he who ſhuns death when it comes convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus much may ſuffice to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, my ſtrength now failing me. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Succeſſor I wittingly ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, leſt through imprudence I ſhould paſs by a worthie perſon, or by naming one I conceive fitly qualified, if another ſhould chance to be preferred, bring him into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger; but as a dutiful Son of the Commonwealth, I wiſh her a good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in my room.</q>

               <p>Having ſpoken this, he perceived his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to weep, whom he gravely rebuked, affirming it <hi>a pitiful mean thing to bemoan a Prince that was a friend to Heaven and the Stars.</hi> And they being ſilent, he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſubtile diſcourſe with <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcus,</hi> two Philoſophers; concerning the <hi>ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of Souls;</hi> till ſuch time as the Wound gaping, and the Tumor of the Veſſels inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his Breath, having called for a draught of <hi>cold Water,</hi> he died the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about Midnight, in the 32d year of his <hi>Age,</hi> and the ſecond of his <hi>Empire;</hi> having been <hi>Caeſar</hi> Six years.

               <p>I Shall compriſe theſe under the Heads mentioned by <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> l. 25. c. 5. <hi>(viz.) Temperance, Prudence, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice:</hi> all which (ſaith that Author) he ſo <hi>ſtudied</hi> and <hi>attained,</hi> as if they had been <hi>but One.</hi> As to his <hi>Temperance</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> he was ſo unſpotted, that after the death of his Wife in <hi>France,</hi> he never medled with any woman; nor was he accuſed of the leaſt immodeſty while he was young, and in his full ſtrength, by thoſe that were of his Bed-chamber. To which vertue his <hi>ſpare dyet</hi> and <hi>ſhort ſleep</hi> very much contributed. His dyet was always ſo <hi>ſlender,</hi> as if he intended to return again to his Books. His Supper was uſually a little <hi>Gruel,</hi> ſuch as a <hi>common Souldier</hi> would refuſe, <hi>l.</hi> 24. <hi>c.</hi> 2. which he took ſtanding, and preſently went to view his Guards and Sentinels, and then returned to his Study, ſcarce allowing
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:96115:202"/>himſelf ſo much ſolace as might content the neceſſities of Nature. What was provided for him as an Emperour, he ſeldom taſted of, but diſtributed it amongſt his poor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>He ſays in his <hi>Miſopogon,</hi> that <hi>he had been taught from his youth to wage war with his belly.</hi> And never frequented <hi>Theatres</hi> or <hi>Games;</hi> which he never beheld but with as much <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs</hi> as others did with <hi>delight.</hi> He uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lay onely on a Palate ſpread on the ground, and would ſcarce eat enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Hunger; abſtaining from <hi>Feaſts</hi> and <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meetings,</hi> ſaying, <hi>No man ought to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as temperate at home, who was diſſolute abroad, and took pleaſure in the Threatres.</hi> His garments and manner of dreſs was very plain and neglected, and far from curious or court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſhions. <hi>Doſt thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deſire to ſee the Circenſian Games? you ſhall find them moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly deſcribed by</hi> Homer; <hi>take the Book, and read.</hi> Such inſtructions he ſays he had from his <hi>Tutors,</hi> and them he followed with great pleaſure, p. 79.</p>
               <p>He was extremely delighted in the ſociety of <hi>learned Men</hi> and <hi>good Books,</hi> for which he often profeſſed <hi>he could willingly leave his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> What intercourſe he had with the chief Philoſophers of his time, appears by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to <hi>Libanius, Iamblicus, Eumenius,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:96115:202"/>Themiſtius, Elpidius,</hi> and <hi>Maximus.</hi> This laſt, though one of the worſt of them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit him, of which he was informed while he ſate in Judicature, he ſpeedily laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his <hi>buſineſs</hi> and his <hi>Robes,</hi> and went forth in a familiar manner to meet him and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him. To the reſt, in his Epiſtles he deſired their <hi>preſence</hi> or their <hi>Books;</hi> and ſtiled himſelf, <hi>Their moſt dear Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his <hi>Prudence.</hi> This was a Maxim with him, <hi>That it was a ſhame for a wiſe man, having a Soul, to ſeek for commendation from any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Body.</hi> His proficiency in <hi>all manner of learning,</hi> gave him great inſight as well to <hi>Martial</hi> as <hi>Civil Affairs;</hi> which he ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that though he adventured on many great and hazardous attempts, yet he moſtly came off with good ſucceſs. He could by his <hi>Eloquence,</hi> as by a <hi>Mercury-Rod,</hi> appeaſe the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults</hi> and <hi>Seditions</hi> of his <hi>Souldiers;</hi> and would threaten them, that <hi>if they continued their Mutinies, he would betake himſelf to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he ſhewed another inſtance of his <hi>Prudence</hi> in remitting many <hi>Taxes,</hi> rather than to extort them from the poorer ſort of people: nor did he exact on the <hi>Rich,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that his treaſure was ſafeſt in the cuſtody of his good Subjects.</hi>

               <p>His <hi>Juſtice</hi> appeared alſo in many notable inſtances: for he rather <hi>ſhook</hi> the Sword than <hi>ſtruck</hi> with it: and though he made himſelf terrible, yet was he never cruel; but ſought by the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of a <hi>few,</hi> to reſtrain the <hi>vices</hi> of <hi>many.</hi> He pardoned many that had ſought to take away his life. <hi>Thalaſſius</hi> an enemy to him and his Brother <hi>Gallus</hi> was forbid the Court, which encouraged his enemies to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him; but <hi>Julian</hi> perceiving it to be of Malice, told them, that <hi>Thalaſſius had injured

               <p>When one accuſed a great Citizen for a <hi>Traytor,</hi> hoping to be rewarded out of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <hi>Julian</hi> ask'd him what the condition of the man was: he anſwered, <hi>he was a rich Burger, and had made him purple Cloths againſt the Inſurrection. If that be all</hi> (ſaith <hi>Julian</hi>) <hi>you ſhall carry him a pair of purple Shoes too; and let him know, how little ſucceſs he can hope for from ſuch things, without greater power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would ſay of himſelf, <hi>That Juſtice which in former times had left the earth, was returned again,</hi> l. 25. c. 6. And if we believe <hi>Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> although he would ſometimes inquire of what <hi>Religion</hi> the parties litigant were, yet he would do nothing <hi>partially</hi> againſt any for their <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his <hi>Fortitude,</hi> beſides his patient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of extream <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter his Enemies <hi>hand to hand;</hi> and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his own <hi>Perſon,</hi> would keep his <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> from giving ground to the <hi>Enemy;</hi> which he often did both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers Enemies with his own hand.</p>
               <p>But he had a <hi>better</hi> kind of <hi>Fortitude</hi> than this; namely, that which more becomes a Man, to conquer his own Paſſions, to bear
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:96115:204"/>with Reproaches, to endure croſs events with patience. <hi>As for me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I reſolve to bear whatever falls on me from above with a ſtout mind; for this is the property of good men, to do their duty, and to be of a good hope, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelves to what ever fatal neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall impoſe,</hi> p. 218. And as men of true <hi>valour</hi> and <hi>magnanimity</hi> are ſeldom <hi>cruel,</hi> he expreſſed a <hi>natural clemency</hi> in all his actions; thoſe againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> towards his later end, only excepted; which yet I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be executed, but upon ſome great <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> by the <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>ungovernable</hi> among the vulgar ſort of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Of which the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of that time given <hi>many inſtances.</hi>

               <p>ALthough we might wiſh that <hi>Julian</hi> had never known <hi>Letters,</hi> becauſe of thoſe <hi>virulent Satyrs</hi> which he wrote againſt <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi> yet the Poiſon wherewith his Writings do abound, having excellent Remedies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared againſt the venome of them, by the Learned Fathers of that Age, ſuch as <hi>Greg.

My opinion is, that <hi>Julians</hi> Vices were <hi>real</hi> and <hi>deep rooted,</hi> that he had but the <hi>umbrage</hi> and <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>Vertue;</hi> which he therefore retained, that he might make them ſerve his <hi>Pride, Popularity,</hi> and <hi>vain-glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he came to be <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he redeemed what <hi>time</hi> he could for his <hi>ſtudy,</hi> dividing the night into three parts: one for <hi>ſleep,</hi> another for his <hi>Books,</hi> and the third for his <hi>Military Affairs;</hi> and uſually he would pen one of his <hi>Orations</hi> in that part of the night.</p>

               <p>He wrote his <hi>Miſopogon</hi> to revenge himſelf upon the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> who had abuſed him in

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>IT appears by what hath been ſaid, That <hi>Julian</hi> was a <hi>perfidious</hi> and <hi>deteſtable Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate:</hi> A <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>ſubtile Perſecutor;</hi> who <hi>deſigned much more</hi> againſt the Chriſtians, than God permitted him to <hi>practiſe.</hi> But as there is an <hi>open</hi> and <hi>declared Apoſtacie</hi> and <hi>Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> by <hi>profeſſed Enemies:</hi> ſo is there a <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>real revolt</hi> from the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>perſecution</hi> of its <hi>Diſciples,</hi> by ſome that <hi>profeſs</hi> themſelves <hi>Friends</hi> to the ſame. And in our <hi>own Age</hi> we have known <hi>ſome,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Roman,</hi> but <hi>other Perſwaſions,</hi> who
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:96115:207"/>may be <hi>parallel'd with,</hi> and in ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances <hi>exceed Julian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Julian,</hi> being a <hi>Great Prince,</hi> had the <hi>unhappineſs</hi> of being bred in <hi>forein Countries</hi> among <hi>ſubtile Pagans,</hi> who tempted him to <hi>their impieties</hi> in his <hi>youth:</hi> There are <hi>ſome</hi> who have had their <hi>whole Education</hi> among <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> and <hi>ſincere Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and yet <hi>revolt</hi> from it. <hi>Julian</hi> for Six years together faithfully <hi>ſerved</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> in his <hi>Wars,</hi> to the great <hi>hazard</hi> of his <hi>Life;</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even in <hi>times of peace,</hi> ſtudy to involve their <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>unnatural Wars,</hi> to the <hi>endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering</hi> of <hi>his</hi> and <hi>their own Lives. Julian</hi> had a <hi>power</hi> to have executed his <hi>malicious deſigns,</hi> but was <hi>reſtrained:</hi> Others live under a <hi>juſt power,</hi> and enjoy <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> yet their perverſe Wills admit of <hi>no reſtraint. Julian</hi> employed his <hi>Wit</hi> in writing againſt his <hi>Chriſtian Subjects;</hi> Others employ <hi>theirs</hi> in writing againſt their <hi>Chriſtian Governours.</hi> He wrote <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of a <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who had contrived <hi>his death:</hi> Others write <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> and <hi>Libels</hi> againſt their <hi>Princes</hi> to whom they <hi>owe their Lives.</hi> In a word, the greateſt <hi>aggravation</hi> of <hi>Julian's Apoſtacie,</hi> was, that he had been a <hi>Lecturer</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> the truths of which he <hi>renounced,</hi> and wrote againſt them: And there are <hi>ſome</hi> who have been long in the <hi>Order of Prieſthood,</hi> that
